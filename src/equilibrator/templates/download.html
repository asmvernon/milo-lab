        <p>eQuilibrator data is given in two formats. Tabular data is given as CSV and hierarchichal data is given in JSON.
          <ul>
            <li>
            JSON: the <a href="http://www.json.org">JavaScript Object Notation</a> format is a
            lightly structured hierarchical format that is easily parsed in most modern programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>
            CSV: Comma-Separated Value format is a flat format that is mostly unstructured, easy to parse
            and easy to view in Excel and other spreadsheet programs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        Measured thermodynamic data is drawn from the work of Robert Alberty (<a href="/data_refs">references here</a>).
        We use our own implementation of the group-contribution approximation method to provide formation energies
        when measurements are not available. Because these data rely on different assumptions, mixing formation
        energies from different sources can lead to errors. As such, we offer data on compounds and reactions
        from the various sources in separate files.

        <div class="title">Pseudoisomer Energies</div>
        
        <p>
        The standard Gibbs energies of formation of the various protonation states (pseudoisomers) of 
        biochemical compounds in the KEGG database are available for download in a single
        JSON file (<a href="/media/downloads/kegg_pseudoisomers.json.gz">download here</a>). The file contains many entries,
         each representing a compound in KEGG. A single compound is represented as follows:
         </p>
         
        <pre class="jsonPre">
    {
        "CID": "C00631", 
        "InChI": "InChI=1S/C3H7O7P/c4-1-2(3(5)6)10-11(7,8)9/h2,4H,1H2,(H,5,6)(H2,7,8,9)/t2-/m1/s1", 
        "formula": "C3H7O7P", 
        "mass": 185.9929, 
        "name": "2-Phospho-D-glycerate", 
        "num_electrons": 96, 
        "pmaps": [ ... ]
    }
        </pre>
        
        <p>
        Each listed compound will likely have a KEGG ID ("CID"), a chemical formula ("formula"), an InChI identifier ("InChI"),
        a mass ("mass"), a common name ("name") and a number of electrons ("num_electrons"). When values are are unknown
        they are omitted.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In addition, compounds for which thermodynamic data is available will contain a list of pseudoisomer maps ("pmaps").
        Each pseudoisomer map contains thermodynamic data on compound pseudoisomers from a single source.
        In the example below, the first source is "Alberty (2006)" and the second source is our PGC method ("Group Contribution").

        <p>
        Each pseudoisomer map has a "source" and a "priority" and contains data on a number of psuedoisomers (a word on priorities later).
        Each pseudoisomer in a map has a characteristic number of hydrogens ("nH") and charge ("z"). The standard Gibbs energy of
        formation is given as "dG0_f" and a reference is given for the data ("ref"). If an acid dissociation constant
        was used to compute the Gibbs energy of the pseudoisomer then reference represents the source of the pK<sub>a</sub> data 
        (for example "ChemAxon").
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As mentioned above, it is important not to mix measured and approximated data in thermodynamic calculations (more than is necessary).
        As such, each pseudoisomer map has an associated "priority". When calculating reactions energies, always use data from
        the <b>same priority level</b>. The priority tags are designed to prevent erroneous mixing of measured and approximate data.
