			<div class="faqQuestion" id="compoundSearch">How do I search for a compound?</div>
			
			<div class="faqAnswer">You can search for a compound by entering a common name of the compound.
			As you type, you should see a list of potential matches, which should give you a sense of what eQuilibrator
			thinks you are looking for. You can select a compound from the list or type the name in full.
			Either way, hit 'Search' when you are done typing the compound name.
			
			You should see up to 5 compounds on the search results page. These are the top matches for your query.
			If the compound you're interested in is present, click on it to see more details and to change the 
			conditions of &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G estimation.

			<div class="faqQuestion" id="rxnSearch">How do I search for a reaction?</div>
			
			<div class="faqAnswer">You can search for a reaction by entering an (almost) free-text string of the reaction.
			For example, you can type "glucose = 2 ethanol + 2 co2". Spaces before and after stoichiometric coefficients, "+",
			and reaction side delimiters ("=", "<=>", "=>", and "->") are required.

		<div class="faqEntry">
			<div class="faqQuestion" id="notAvailable">Why is &Delta;G "not available?"</div>
			
			<div class="faqAnswer">&Delta;<sub>f</sub>G is very difficult to measure experimentally. We use the group contribution
			method to estimate &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G for compounds that have not been characterized experimentally. In some cases,
			a compound will contain a group that was not observed in any of the compounds that have experimental measurements.
			We cannot produce estimates for these compounds. Likewise, we can't produce &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G estimates for any
			reactions containing these compounds.

		<div class="faqEntry">
			<div class="faqQuestion" id="stdConditions">What are "standard conditions?"</div>
			
			<div class="faqAnswer">"Standard conditions" implies that all substrates and products of a reaction are at 1 M concentration.
			If there are a different number of substrates and products then their concentrations can effect the &Delta;<sub>r</sub>G.
