COMMON-NAME - tRNA processing pathway I

COMMENT - tRNAs are the molecular adapters that allow the synthesis of proteins based on mRNAs transcribed from protein-coding genes. The active form of tRNA is generated by a combination of nuclease-based processing, the modification of select nucleosides, and finally charging via the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.
/
/tRNA processing is a multi-step pathway carried out by a mix of endonucleases and exonucleases. Processing begins with the endonucleolytic cleavage of individual tRNA precursors from RNAs containing multiple tRNAs. This initial cleavage can generate precursor molecules with a long 5' trailing end or with a short 5' extension. Precursors with a long trailer require additional exonucleolytic processing before the other nucleases in the pathway can act.
/
/Following this initial processing step, a suite of ribonucleases cut down the 5' and 3' ends to yield the final, processed tRNA.
/
/Although this processing pathway can function with as a few as one of its constituent exonucleases, the final tRNA product may be "imperfect," with a 3' end that may be longer or shorter than normal.

UNIQUE-ID - ASPASN-PWY
TYPES - Amino-Acid-Biosynthesis
TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - superpathway of aspartate and asparagine biosynthesis; interconversion of aspartate and asparagine
COMMENT - Aspartate undergoes a number of reactions that are not in
/any linear order.  One reaction converts the TCA intermediate fumarate to
/aspartate.  Another reaction irreversibly converts aspartate to
/asparagine. A third reaction facilitates reversible interconversion of
/aspartate and asparargine. 
/  In E. coli aspartate participates in at least
/two metabolic processes: the regeneration of oxaloacetate as
/amino-acceptor for enabling growth on glutamate, and the formation of
/fumarate and succinate during anaerobic growth on glucose.
/|CITS: [6088667] [2853974]|
/
/In
/addition to its role in synthesis of asparagine, aspartate serves as a
/precursor in synthesis of lysine, methionine and threonine, plus the
/pyrimidines.  Also the intermediate argininosuccinate hydrolyses to
/give citrulline and aspartate.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis
COMMENT - In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan are biosynthesized from the principal common precursor chorismate.  The conversion of chorismate to prephenate leads to the terminal pathways of phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis.  The conversion of chorismate to anthranilate leads to the biosynthesis of tryptophan.  Chorismate is also the precursor for biosynthesis of other essential compunds, as shown in the |FRAME: ALL-CHORISMATE-PWY|.

CITATIONS - 2890623:EV-EXP-IDA:3374945543:shearer
COMMENT - Alanine is an essential component of protein (as L-alanine) and peptidoglycan (as a roughly 3:1 mix of D- and L-alanine).  Only about a tenth of total alanine synthesized is incorporated into peptidoglycan.
/
/At least three pathways (|FRAME: ALANINE-VALINESYN-PWY|, |FRAME: ALANINE-SYN2-PWY|, and |FRAME: PWY0-1021|) contribute to the synthesis of alanine.  The evidence for alanine biosynthesis II initially came from cell extract studies and the isolation of the still-unsequenced gene <i>alaB</i> during a screen for genes able to complement an alanine auxotroph |CITS: [2890623]|.  Recently, the two major glutamate-pyruvate aminotransferases AlaA and AlaC were identified.  AlaA and AlaC together account for 90% of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity in the cell |CITS: [20729367]|.

COMMENT - L-alanine is an essential component of protein and peptidoglycan.  The latter also contains about three molecules of D-alanine for every L-alanine.  Only about 10 percent of the total alanine synthesized flows into peptidoglycan.
/
/At least three pathways (alanine biosynthesis I, alanine biosynthesis II, and alanine biosynthesis III) contribute to the synthesis of alanine.  Alanine biosynthesis I is established only by existence of the relevant enzymes.  Its contribution to alanine synthesis remains speculative because alanine auxotrophs have not yet been isolated.  Because alanine but not valine represses AvtA, its primary purpose is probably synthesis of L-alanine |CITS: [396446][7040341]|.  Existence of the Alanine biosyntheis II  pathways rests on the evidence that glutamate-pyruvate aminotransferase acitivity is found in crude cell extracts; the enzymes has not been purified nor have mutant alleles of its designated encoding gene (<i>alaB</i>) been isolated |CITS: [396446][4146872]|.  The conversion can also be mediated as a side reaction of alanine racemase |CITS: [9832621]|.  The alanine biosyntheis III pathway, mediated by cysteine desulfurase activity, which is required to donate sulfane sulfur for the synthesis of Fe-S clusters, thiamine, thionucleosides in tRNAs, biotin, lipoic acid, and molybdopterin |CITS: [12382038]|, probably contributes only a minor amount of the cell's alanine requirement, as judged by the cell's total requirement for sulfane sulfur.

COMMENT - |FRAME: ASN| is synthesized in E. coli from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| by either of two reactions,
/utilizing either |FRAME: GLN| or |FRAME: AMMONIA| as the amino group donor.
/Both reactions are ATP driven and yield AMP and pyrophosphate.
/
/The first reaction is catalyzed only by |FRAME: ASNSYNB-CPLX|, while the second reaction is
/catalyzed by both |FRAME: ASNSYNA-CPLX| and |FRAME: ASNSYNB-CPLX|,
/
/Null mutations in both encoding genes, |FRAME: EG10091| and |FRAME: EG10092|, result in
/asparagine auxotrophy, as does a null mutation only in |FRAME: EG10092| under conditions of

COMMENT - |FRAME: B-ALANINE| is an important precursor of |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE| biosynthesis.  In bacteria,
/the main route of |FRAME: B-ALANINE| synthesis is the single-step decarboxylation of
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|.
/
/&beta;-alanine biosynthesis by L-aspartate decarboxylation appears to be exclusive to prokaryotes. 
/Eukaryotes employ alternative multi-step pathways to achieve the same goal (see |FRAME: PWY-3981|,
/|FRAME: PWY-3941| and |FRAME: PWY-3982|). 
/
/The enzyme catalyzing the decarboxylation of L-aspartate, |FRAME:CPLX0-2901|, is one of a small class
/of enzymes that use a covalently bound pyruvoyl prosthetic group.  The pyruvoyl group is thought to act
/analogously to a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor by forming a Schiff base with the amino group of the
/substrate and then serving as an electron sink to facilitate the decarboxylation |CITS: [2197977]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The pathway of cysteine biosynthesis is a two-step conversion starting from
/L-serine and yielding L-cysteine.
/
/This pathway is regulated at the genetic level in its second step, wtih both
/cysteine synthase isozymes being under the positive control of the cysteine-responsive
/transcription factor CysB. It is also subject to very strong feedback inhibition
/of its first step by the final pathway product, cysteine.
/
/Although two cysteine synthase isozymes exist, only cysteine synthase A (CysK) forms
/a complex with serine acetyltransferase. CysK is also the only one of the two
/cysteine synthases that is required for cell viability on cysteine-free medium.
/
/Both steps in this pathway are reversible. Based on genetic and proteomic data,
/it appears that the cysteine synthases may actually act as a sulfur scavenging
/system during sulfur starvation, stripping sulfur off of L-cysteine, generating
/any number of variant amino acids in the process.

COMMENT - There are two pathways by which <i>E. coli</i> synthesizes glutamate from ammonia.  If complex
/sources of nitrogen are available, still other pathways (see below) become available and take over
/glutamate synthesis.  The pathway shown here is one of the steps in one of the pathways by which
/glutamate is synthesized from ammonia.  The other step (|FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|) in this pathway is
/the synthesis of glutamine from ammonia.  Then in the step shown here that amido group is transferred to
/&alpha;-ketoglutarate yielding glutamate.  Because glutamine biosynthesis utilizes glutamate and the
/reaction shown here yields 2 molecules of glutamate, these two reactions function as a cycle (see
/|FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|), each turn of which produces one molecule of glutamate at the expense of
/one molecule each of ammonia, ATP, NADPH, and &alpha;-ketoglutarate.  The other
/ammonia-to-glutamate pathway, the one catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase
/(|FRAME: GLUTSYNIII-PWY|), also utilizes NADPH, and &alpha;-ketoglutarate, but it does not require
/ATP to drive the reaction.  The K<sub>m</sub> for ammonia in this reaction is much higher than the
/K<sub>m</sub> for ammonia in ATP-driven cyclic pathway.
/
/The two ammonia-to-glutamate pathways are regulated so as to operate under different environmental
/circumstances.  The ATP-independent pathway functions when ammonia is abundant; the ATP-driven
/pathway functions when concentrations of ammonia are low.  The ATP-independent pathway offers
/significant energy savings because when functioning, the ATP-driven pathway utilizes over 10 percent of
/the cell's total expenditure of ATP.
/
/If complex sources of nitrogen are available, glutamate can be synthesized from arginine
/(|FRAME: AST-PWY|) or proline (|FRAME: PROUT-PWY|) or from &alpha;-ketoglutarate by
/transamination of the amino group from arginine or aspartate. 
/
/The complexity of glutamate biosynthesis reflects the quantitatively central role that this amino acid plays
/in the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>.  It is a major constituent of <i>E. coli</i>'s proteins and because it is
/a major nitrogen donor for other biosyntheses, about 80% of the cell's nitrogen flows through glutamate
/when <i>E. coli</i> is growing on a medium containing ammonia as the total source of nitrogen.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>
/
/The amino acid glutamine is a constituent of proteins and a nitrogen donor for many biosynthetic reactions, 
/including the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, glucosamime and carbamoyl phosphate.  The 
/biosynthesis of glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase, a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism found in 
/all domains of life.  Phylogenetic analysis of glutamine synthetase genes has suggested that they are among the 
/oldest functioning genes in the history of evolution |CITS: [8096645]|.  In microorganisms and plants, glutamine 
/synthetase (also known as GS) has a role in ammonia assimilation in combination with glutamate synthase 
/(glutamine: &alpha;-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, or GOGAT) as indicated by the pathway links and pathways 
/|FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-3282|).  This is known as the GS/GOGAT pathway 
/|CITS: [GOTTSCHALK1986]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/This pathway serves as a major mechanism of ammonia assimilation during nitrogen limitation. It has only one reaction, which is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase. There are three types of glutamine synthetase, differing in number of subunits. Glutamine synthetase type I is found mostly in bacteria and archaea, including <i>E. coli</i> (reviewed in |CITS: [11585846]|). It is a well-studied homododecamer built from two back-to-back hexameric rings |CITS: [5336023][242004][241853][3654][28418]|. The enzyme contains two metal-binding sites (n1 and n2) to which Mg2+ or Mn2+ can bind. Binding at the n1 site leads to stabilization of the protein and facilitates the binding of glutamate to the catalytic site, whereas metal binding to the n2 site is implicated in phosphoryl transfer (reviewed in: Stadtman E. R (2004) "Regulation of Glutamine Synthetase Activity." EcoSal 3.6.1.6 |CITS: [ecosal]|.

COMMENT - The pathway of histidine biosynthesis comprises ten reactions carried out by
/nine enzymes coded for by eight genes. There are nine free and one enzyme-bound
/intermediate. This complexity derives from the existence of three bifunctional
/proteins in the pathway as well as one holoenzyme composed of two separate
/gene products.
/
/The overall regulation of the pathway stems from feedback inhibition of
/the first pathway step by the final product of the pathway, <i>L</i>-histidine.
/
/The histidine biosynthesis pathway shares metabolites with
/the purine and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. This affords the
/opportunity to connect synthesis of amino acids with the synthesis of
/nucleotides. The common metabolites are PRPP (which is also
/fundamental to intermediate metabolism), and
/5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR).

COMMENT - The pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis from threonine is a five-step pathway
/that shares its last four steps with the pathway of valine biosynthesis. These
/entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates
/not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.
/
/As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis
/of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject
/to regulation by all three amino acids. The first enzyme in the pathway, L-threonine
/deaminase, is downregulated by isoleucine and leucine, but is upregulated by valine.
/The following pathway step, catalyzed by acetohydroxybutanoate synthases (AHAS) I and III,
/is inhibited by all three amino acids. This apparent paradox of valine stimulation of step
/one followed by valine inhibition of step two is a product of the preference of AHAS III
/for processing of the isoleucine precursor 2-oxobutanoate rather than the valine
/precursor pyruvate. When valine is abundant in the cell, both AHAS enzymes are inhibited,
/blocking valine production and potentially disrupting isoleucine synthesis as well.
/However, the stimulation of L-threonine deaminase generates
/a substantial pool of 2-oxobutanoate. Combined with the high affinity of AHAS III for
/this compound, this allows the isoleucine synthesis to continue despite inhibition caused
/by the parallel valine synthesis pathway.
/
/Enteric bacteria such as |FRAME:ECOLI| and |FRAME:TAX-90371| have been shown to possess two types of
/threonine dehydratases - a catabolic enzyme, which is induced by threonine, and a consistitutively-
/produced biosynthetic enzyme |CITS: [13405870]|. Both enzymes convert threonine to
/|FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|, but differ in their regulation and expression.
/
/Biosynthetic threonine dehydratases were also described in several soil bacteria |CITS: [16743051]|.
/A survey of 75 soil isolates capable of growth on L-threonine revealed a group of three organisms
/that possessed substantial L-threonine dehydratase activity, to the exclusion of any other
/threonine-catabolyzing enzyme|CITS: [5076220]|.  The group consisted of |FRAME:ORG-5895| and two
/<i>Brevibacterium</i> isolates. The enzyme from |FRAME:ORG-5895| was partially purified, and was
/found to be of the biosynthetic type on the criteria that its formation was consitutive, it was susceptible
/to inhibition by |FRAME:ILE|, |FRAME:VAL| protected against denaturation and was a positive effector
/and antagonist of isoleucine, and neither AMP nor ADP acted as effectors |CITS: [16743051]|.
/Interestingly, even though the enzyme was of the biosynthetic type, the researchers found that
/much of the threonine in these organisms was converted to |FRAME:PROPIONATE| in a catabolic
/pathway identical to that described in |FRAME:PWY-5437|. Thus, the biosynthetic enzyme was recruited
/to a catabolic pathway.
/
/A biosynthetic threonine dehydratase was also reported in |FRAME:TAX-615| |CITS: [355220]|.

CITATIONS - 1646790:EV-EXP-IMP:3380400286:shearer
COMMENT - Leucine biosynthesis involves a five-step conversion process
/starting with the valine precursor 2-keto-isovalerate. The final
/step in this pathway is catalyzed by two transaminases of broad
/specificity, IlvE and TyrB.
/
/Both the first enzyme in the pathway,
/2-isopropylmalate synthase, and the terminal transaminase TyrB
/are suppressed by leucine. TyrB is subject to inhibition
/by the pathway's starting compound, 2-keto-isovalerate, and by one
/of its off-pathway products, tyrosine. One consequence of this
/inhibition by 2-keto-isovalerate is that in the absence of IlvE activity,
/mutations in earlier
/steps in the pathway cannot be compensated for by any alternate
/method of introducing 2-ketoisocaproate for conversion to leucine.
/
/Almost all of the genes coding for enzymes in this pathway are
/controlled by attenuation. Attenuation in operon |FRAME: TU00179|
/is effected by a leader region containing four leucines and
/a transcriptional terminator |CITS: [6171647][6195343]|. <i>ilvE</i>
/is a component of operon |FRAME: TU524|, that has an attenuation
/region containing codons for isoleucine, leucine, and valine, as
/well as a termination site |CITS: [6154938][2007556]|.

COMMENT - The synthesis of lysine, methionine and threonine share
/the first two reactions of the three pathways, the reactions
/converting L-aspartate to L-aspartate semialdehyde.  There are three
/aspartate kinases, three isozymes coded for by the lysC, metL and thrA genes, one
/specific for synthesis of each end product amino acid.  Each of the
/three aspartate kinase isozymes is regulated by its corresponding end
/product amino acid.  The second reaction is also shared, catalyzed by
/aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.  In this case a single enzyme
/coded by the asd gene serves all three pathways.  The third reaction
/is shared by the methionine and threonine pathways.  Homoserine
/dehydrogenase, part of multifunctional enzymes, is coded by the metL
/and thrA genes.  Therefore, independent regulation of the three
/pathways is possible.  The synthesis of methionine is linked to
/intermediary metabolism through pyruvate and succinyl CoA.  Also the
/amino acid cysteine is linked with methionine through O-succinyl
/homserine.  Also, the last reaction of the methionine pathway
/lies at the point of convergence of two major biosynthetic
/pathways, that for homocysteine and for methyl group transfer via
/tetrahydrofolate derivatives.  |CITS: [2407589] [4947102]|

COMMENT - <b>Background</b>
/
/About 20% of the |FRAME: MET| pool is used as a building block of proteins.  The rest is converted to |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), the major methyl donor in the cell.  When SAM donates its methyl group, it is converted to |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS|.  This molecule can be recycled back to SAM via the <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle, also known as the activated methyl cycle (AMC).
/
/There are two main variations of this pathway, one found mostly in prokaryotes, while the other is found predominantly, but not exclusively, in eukaryotes.  The main difference between the variants is the processing of |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS| (SAH), the immediate product of the methylation reactions.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway, SAH is first hydrolyzed to |FRAME: CPD-564| by |FRAME: CPLX0-1541|, followed by conversion to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| by |FRAME: EG12712-MONOMER|.  The cycle continues with the methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| to |FRAME: MET| using a methyl group from a methylated folate.  Finally, the cycle is completed with the regeneration of SAM by |FRAME: S-ADENMETSYN-CPLX|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/While the amino acid |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| is not involved directly in protein synthesis, it is an important intermediate in many metabolic pathways, such as the |FRAME: PWY-4984| and the biosynthesis of several compounds, including arginine (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), proline (see |FRAME: PWY-3341| and |FRAME: PWY-4981|) and putrescine (|FRAME: PWY-46|), which leads to the biosynthesis of other polyamines and pyrimidines.
/
/This pathway documents the synthesis of |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| from |FRAME: GLT| via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PROSYN-PWY|), thus keeping the pathways leading to arginine and proline separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein). 
/
/Two alternative pathways have evolved, which differ in the way the key intermediate |FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another intermediate,  |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|. In this pathway, which is less common, NAG is formed by NAG synthase and |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, forming |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| and |FRAME: ACET|. In the other pathway (see |FRAME: ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto |FRAME: GLT|, regenerating |FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG). 
/
/In ornithine biosynthesis pathway in <i>E. coli</i>, |FRAME: GLT| is acetylated to NAG by the enzyme |FRAME: N-ACETYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, encoded by the <i>argA</i> gene. The acetyl donor for this reaction is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|. NAG is then converted in several enzymatic steps to |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|. The acetyl group is removed in the form of |FRAME: ACET| by the enzyme |FRAME: ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX|, encoded by the <i>argE</i> gene, resulting in |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE|.

COMMENT - The pathways of biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine are intimately connected.  The first step of
/both pathways is the conversion of chorismate to prephenate; the third step of both is the conversion of a
/ketoacid to an aminoacid through transamination.  The two pathways differ only in the second step of their
/three-step reaction sequences:  In the case of phenylalanine biosynthesis a dehydratase converts
/prephenate to phenylpyruvate (a reaction that occurs slowly in the absence of enzymic acitivity); in the
/case of tyrosine biosynthesis, a dehydrogenase converts prephenate to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.  Also in
/both pathways the first two steps are catalyzed by two distinct active sites on a single protein.  Thus the
/first step of each pathway can be catalyzed by two enzymes: those associated with both the
/phenylalanine-specific dehydratase and the tyrosine-specific dehydrogenase.  Three enzymes, those
/encoded by <i>tyrB</i>, <i>aspC</i>, and <i>ilvE</i>, are involved in catalyzing the third step of these
/pathways: all three can contribute to the synthesis of phenylalanine; only TyrB and AspC contribute to the
/biosynthesis of tyrosine.
/
/Under normal physiological conditions, TyrB is the primary enzyme contributing to the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  AspC contributes to their synthesis when substrate pools are large.  The contribution of the <i>ilvE</i>-encoded enzyme to phenylalanine biosynthesis was demonstrated in triple mutants of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 that lacked all three aminotransferases and required both phenylalanine and tyrosine for growth.  However, <i>tyrB</i> and <i>aspC</i> double mutants required only tyrosine for growth |CITS: [15983]|.  This suggested a role for IlvE in phenylalanine biosynthesis in the <i>tyrB</i>, <i>aspC</i> double mutants, although its role in strains with functional TyrB and AspC is unknown.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Proline, a cyclic amino acid, is one of the basic building blocks of proteins. In addition, proline has other important functions. It acts as an osmoprotectant in bacteria |CITS: [1741624]|, plants |CITS: [Delauney93]|, and animals |CITS: [16043587]|, and protects cells from osmotic stress,  it participates in free radical scavenging |CITS: [18167531]|, and it serves as a source of carbon and nitrogen |CITS: [3072423]|. Microorganisms, plants, and animals synthesize L-proline from L-glutamate in three steps as shown in this pathway. While plants |CITS: [1384052]| and animals |CITS: [10037775]|, |CITS: [8761662]| employ a single bi-functional enzyme to catalyze the first two steps, in bacteria it is carried out by |FRAME:PROLINEMULTI-CPLX |, a multimeric enzyme complex of two independent mono-functional enzymes.  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of L-proline in <i>E. coli</i> involves the reduction of L-glutamate to glutamate semialdehyde, in two consecutive enzymatic steps. This is followed by a spontaneous dehydration step in which L-glutamate &gamma;-semialdehyde is converted into its cyclic derivative, pyrroline 5-carboxylate, which is subsequently reduced to L-proline. In <i>E. coli</i>, the biosynthesis of L-proline from L-glutamate is governed by three genetic loci namely <i>proB</i>, <i>proA</i> and <i>proC</i>  |CITS: [6319365]|. The first reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME:GLUTKIN-CPLX |, encoded by <i>proB</i> |CITS: [6319365]|. The second reaction, NADPH-dependent reduction of &gamma;-glutamyl phosphate to glutamate-5-semialdehyde, in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME:GLUTSEMIALDEHYDROG-CPLX |, encoded by <i>proA</i> |CITS: [6337636]|. These two enzymes aggregate into a multimeric bi-functional enzyme complex known as |FRAME:PROLINEMULTI-CPLX |.  It is believed that the complex formation serves to protect the highly labile glutamyl phosphate from the hostile nucleophilic and aqueous environment found in the cell |CITS: [4152574]|. The final step in the pathway, the reduction of pyrroline 5-carboxylate to L-proline, is catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent |FRAME:PYRROLINECARBREDUCT-CPLX | encoded by <i>proC</i> |CITS: [12133]|.

COMMENT - Selenocysteine has been called the 21<sup>st</sup> amino acid. It is an essential constituent of 3 proteins 
/in <i>E. coli </i>: formic 
/dehydrogenases, FDH<sub>O</sub>, FDH<sub>N</sub>, and FDH<sub>H</sub>; each of them contains one 
/selenocysteine residue. The biosynthesis of selenocysteine is unique among amino acid biosyntheses because 
/its defining step occurs while attached to a tRNA molecule. The tRNA molecule, tRNA,<sup>sec</sup>, serves only 
/to insert selenocysteine into these proteins. tRNA<sup>sec</sup> has an anticodon that recognizes the stop codon 
/UGA; it also has properties that allow it to be charged with serine by <i>serS</i>-encoded seryl-tRNA synthetase. 
/But it 
/cannot insert serine at an UGA codon. Only after it has been converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> by 
/the action of 
/selenocysteine synthetase can it recognize certain UGAs as sense codons and insert selenocysteine there. 
/Recognition of UGA as a sense codon and insertion of selenocysteine depends on adjacent sequences in mRNA 
/termed SECIS (<b>se</b>leno<b>c</b>ysteine <b>i</b>nsertion <b>s</b>equence) and a special elongation factor 
/termed SELB, the product of selB, 
/which acts in place of EF-T<sub>u</sub> in this special case..
/
/Selenophosphate donates selenium to seryl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup> thereby converting it to 
/selenocysteyl-tRNA<sup>sec</sup>. The 
/physiological source of its selenium, shown here as selenide, is not known for certain. Selenide is synthesized, via 
/selinite, from selenate by the same enzymes that reduce sulfate,via sulfite, to sulfide.

COMMENT - Serine biosynthesis is a major metabolic pathway in <i>E. coli</i>.  Its end product, serine, is not only used in protein

/addition, it directly or indirectly serves as a source of one-carbon units for the biosynthesis of various compounds.
/
/Regulation of the pathway is mainly accomplished by feedback inhibition of the enzyme that catalyzes the first
/committed step, |FRAME: PGLYCDEHYDROG-CPLX|.  The second enzyme in the pathway, 3-phosphoserine
/aminotransferase, requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a cofactor and is also required for the biosynthesis of
/pyridoxal 5'-phosphate itself.  Thus the cell must ensure that the supply of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is adequate.

COMMON-NAME - tryptophan biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> tryptophan is biosynthesized from chorismate, the principal common precursor of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, as well as the essential compounds tetrahydrofolate, ubiquinone-8, menaquinone-8 and enterobactin (enterochelin), as shown in the |FRAME: ALL-CHORISMATE-PWY|.  Five genes encode five enzymes that catalyze tryptophan biosynthesis from chorismate.  The five genes <i>trpE trpD trpC trpB trpA</i> form a single transcription unit, the <i>trp</i> operon.  A weak internal promoter also exists within the <i>trpD</i> structural gene that provides low, constitutive levels of mRNA, although its exact physiological function is unclear |CITS: [6305961]|.
/
/Two of the genes in the <i>trp</i> operon encode bifunctional enzymes, each containing two independent catalytic domains.  Thus, a total of seven catalytic domains are involved in tryptophan biosynthesis.  The two bifunctional enzymes encoded by <i>trp D</i> and <i>trpC</i> appear to have arisen from ancestral gene fusion events with <i>trpG</i> and <i>trpF</i>, respectively.  Gene <i>trpG</i> which encodes a glutamine amidotransferase subunit of anthranilate synthase and gene <i>trpF</i> which encodes a phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase exist separately in some organisms.  Two hetromultimeric, &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> protein complexes participate in the pathway, anthranilate synthase formed from the products of genes <i>trpD</i> and <i>trpE</i> and tryptophan synthase formed from the products of genes <i>trpA</i> and <i>trpB</i>.  Reviewed in |CITS: [15262409] [12966138]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The two last steps in this pathway are catalyzed by a single enzyme, tryptophan synthase, which is composed of two &alpha; and two &beta; subunits (E.C. reaction 4.2.1.20).  However, it has been shown that each of the subunits is responsible for catalyzing an individual step, and is able to catalyze that step on its own.  Thus, the activity of tryptophan synthase was divided into two individual steps in the pathway, each catalyzed by the corresponding subunit.  Indole is not a free intermediate, it is transferred between subunits within the enzyme complex |CITS: [1899028]|.  As shown in the transport links in this pathway, evidence suggests that exogenous serine |CITS: [9852024]| and indole |CITS: [1917834]| may also contribute to tryptophan biosynthesis.
/
/The rate-limiting step in this pathway has not been fully defined.  A spontaneous enol/keto tautomerization of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino-1'-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate has been postulated as rate-limiting in the pathway, but it remains to be proven |CITS: [7727401]|.  In addition, chorismate synthase (see |FRAME: ARO-PWY|) has been proposed as a rate limiting enzyme in the common aromatic pathway (see the superpathway links below) based upon its apparently constitutive synthesis and its relatively low specific activity in cell extracts (see EcoSal reference below).
/
/The biosynthesis of tryptophan is an energetically costly process due to its requirement for D-erythrose-4-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and ATP for chorismate biosynthesis, as well as glutamine, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and serine for the conversion of chorismate to tryptophan.  The pathway is therefore highly regulated at multiple levels and its regulation has been studied in great detail.  Transcriptional regulation by repression is mediated by tryptophan binding to the <i>trp</i> repressor, a product of the unlinked <i>trpR</i> gene.  Regulation also occurs by a complex transcriptional attenuation mechanism involving synthesis of the tryptophan-containing leader peptide encoded by gene <i>trpL</i>, mediated by the availability of tryptophan-charged tRNA<sup>trp</sup> (see EcoCyc transcription unit page |FRAME: TU00067| for a detailed summary of <i>trp</i> operon transcriptional regulation mechanisms).  Post-translational regulation occurs by allosteric feedback inhibiton of anthranilate synthase by tryptophan.  Reviewed in |CITS: [15262409] [12966138] [17601995]|.
/
/The homologous tryptophan operon of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>) has also been well studied and the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway shown here also applies to this organism.

COMMENT - The pathway of valine biosynthesis is a four-step pathway that shares all
/of its steps with the parallel pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis. These
/entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates
/not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.
/
/As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis
/of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject
/to regulation by all three amino acids. The first step in the pathway is primarily
/inhibited by valine, along with inhibition by isoleucine and leucine.
/The potential disruption this might cause to the parallel
/isoleucine biosynthesis pathway step using the same enzymes is resolved by
/upregulation of an earlier step that is unique to isoleucine biosynthesis, as explained
/in the |FRAME:ILEUSYN-PWY| summary. In this way, valine biosynthesis can be regulated
/independently of isoleucine biosynthesis, despite all four valine biosynthesis enzymes
/also participating in isoleucine biosynthesis.

COMMENT - Chorismate is an intermediate in the synthesis of three amino acids: tyrosine, phenylalanine and
/tryptophan.  In addition it is a precursor of folic acid, ubiquinone, menaquinone, and enterochelin.
/ 
/The first reaction in the pathway of synthesis of chorismate is catalyzed by three separate enzymes,
/each of which is subject to feedback inhibition by one of the three amino acids.  However, even in the
/presence of all three amino acids, sufficient enzymatic activity is present to permit synthesis of the other
/four metabolites synthesized from chorismate because the enzyme subject to regulation by tryptophan
/cannot be inhibited more than 60 percent.

TYPES - Trehalose-biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - trehalose biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - 8837441:EV-EXP-IDA:3478357672:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The name trehalose was introduced in 1858 to describe a main constituent of shells that are secreted by various insects on tree leaves in the middle east.  These shells were often dried and used as a sweetening agent, and are believed to be related to the biblical Manna, the food supplied to the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness of Arabia.  One variety of these shells, produced by the beetles <i>Larinus maculatus</i> and <i>Larinus nidificans</i>, was called "trehala manna", and the sugar extracted from it was named trehalique glucose, or trehalose |CITS: [12065209]|.  In fact, trehalose is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere.  It consists of two subunits of glucose bound by an &alpha;:1-1 linkage (&alpha;-D-glucopyranosil &alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and is thus nonreducing.  Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects and mammals |CITS: [11081789]| (and original references described therein). 
/
/In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity, chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation and no internal hydrogen bond formation.  The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Under conditions of elevated osmotic strength, <i>E. coli</i> can regulate the osmotic strength of the cytoplasm by accumulating K<sup>+</sup> ions and some organic molecules, commonly called osmoprotectants or compatible solutes.  The preferred osmoprotectant of <i>E. coli</i> is glycine betaine.  However, its synthesis relies on an external supply of proline, betaines, or choline.  When these compounds are not available, a cell can achieve a moderate level of osmotic tolerance by accumulation of glutamate and trehalose |CITS: [1825082]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> synthesizes and accumulates trehalose only when exposed to osmotic stress |CITS: [2883950]|.  It is synthesized from UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate via trehalose-6-phosphate, by the action of two enzymes, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase.  The genes encoding the two enzymes, <i>otsA</i> and <i>otsB</i>, are both osmotically regulated.  Transcription from these genes increases during osmotic stress |CITS: [3131312]| and when the cells enter stationary phase, and requires the stress sigma factor RpoS |CITS: [1744047]|.  Synthesis of trehalose is also stimulated directly by K<sup>+</sup> ion-dependent activation of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase enzyme |CITS: [3131312]|.
/
/Under osmotic stress, <i>E. coli</i> overproduces trehalose, some of which is excreted to the periplasmic space.  Once there, it is degraded by the periplasmic trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182|).  This process was named "a futile cycle for controlling the cytoplasmic level of trehalose" |CITS: [1825082]|.

COMMON-NAME - glycogen biosynthesis I (from ADP-D-Glucose)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Glycogen is a glucose-containing polysaccharide, comprised of approximately 95% &alpha;-1,4 linkages and 5% &alpha;-1,6 branch glucosyl linkages, with an average chain length of 12 to 14 glucose units.  ADP-glucose is the glucosyl donor, which is transferred to either a maltodextrin or glycogen primer, forming a new &alpha;-1,4-glucosidic linkage.  The first enzyme of the pathway, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, is rate-limiting.  After chain elongation, the formation of the branched &alpha;-1,6-glucosidic linkages from the growing polyglucose chain is catalyzed by the glycogen branching enzyme.

COMMENT - Colanic acid, also known as the M antigen, is an extracellular polysaccharide found in Enterobacteriaceae.
/It is a polyanionic heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose,
/D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with O-acetyl and
/pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]|.
/The sugars need to be activated in the form of nucleotide sugars (|FRAME: UDP-GLUCOSE|,
/|FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE|, |FRAME: UDP-GALACTOSE|
/and |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE|, respectively) prior to their assembly |CITS: [8759852] [8763957]|.
/
/The |FRAME: CPD0-1099| polysaccharide repeat is assembled on the membrane lipid
/|FRAME: CPD-9650| by a series of glycosyl transferases on the cytoplasmic face of the inner
/membrane, after which the single repeat is flipped to the periplasmic side and polymerized by the
/Wzy-dependent pathway (reviewed in |CITS: [12045108]| and |CITS: [16756484]|).
/Subsequently, the polymer is believed to be cleaved from the |FRAME: CPD-9650| anchor, transported
/across the periplasm, and excreted into the extracellular space, although this process is not well
/understood.
/
/|FRAME: CPD0-1099| biosynthesis has been linked to a cluster of 19 genes, which were named
/<i>wca</i> |CITS:[8759852][8763957]|. This gene cluster is tightly regulated by a complex signal
/transduction cascade governed by the rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) phosphorelay system

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of KDO<SUB>2</SUB>-lipid A biosynthesis
COMMENT - Lipid A is the hydrophobic anchor of the outer membrane 
/lipopolysaccharide of E. coli.  Free lipid A does not exist
/as such in cells. It is normally found glycosylated with two
/KDO (3-deoxy-D-<I>manno</I>-octulosonic acid) residues 
/and acylated with laurate and myristate residues. 
/
/However if E. coli cells are subjected to cold shock or
/grown at low temperatures the laurate residue is replaced
/by palmitoleate. Myristate is subsequently added, resulting 
/in a distinct cold adapted form of KDO<SUB>2</SUB>-lipid A.

/A PagP homodimer can catalyze palmitate transfer from a phospholipid (<i>sn</i>-1 position) to lipid A or to a lipid A precursor (N-linked hydroxymyristate on the proximal unit) |CITS: [11013210]|.  The catalytic site localizes to the exterior of the outer membrane, indicating that enzyme activity may require outer membrane problems that result in mislocalization of palmitate-donor phospholipids from the interior face to the exterior face of the outer membrane |CITS: [12357033]|.

COMMENT - KDO, 3-deoxy-D-<I>manno</I>-octulosonate, is a component of lipopolysaccharide. KDO is added to the lipid A precursor, lipid IV<SUB>A</SUB>, in two sequential steps resulting in two distinct KDO residues per lipid IV<SUB>A</SUB>.

/Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major outer membrane component, is composed of three domains: Lipid A; the core, which is an oligosaccharide consisting of an inner and outer region; and a distal repeating unit known as O-antigen. Strains of <I>E. coli</I> K-12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|. Lipid A is a &beta;-1,6-linked glucosamine disaccharide. Attached to this is the inner core containing at least two 3-deoxy-D-<I>manno</I>-octulosonate units followed by two units of heptose. The outer core region and the O-antigen are attached to one of the heptose units.

COMMENT - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major outer membrane component, is composed of three
/domains: Lipid A; the core, which is an oligosaccharide consisting of an inner
/and outer region; and a distal repeating unit known as O-antigen. 
/
/E. coli K12 is capable of producing an O-antigen when all the rfb genes are 
/intact. The O-antigen is part of the lipopolysaccharide and is attached to the
/lipid A-core component, which is separately synthesized. The O-antigen is a
/repeat unit composed of four sugars: glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose
/and rhamnose.  
/
/This pathway depicts the synthesis of three of these sugars. UDP-galactose
/is transformed from its pyranose form to its furanose form. dTTP glucose-1-phosphate
/is derivatized to dTDP-rhamnose. Fructose-6-phosphate gains an amino group,
/incorporates an acetate moiety and then acquires a nucleoside diphosphate  
/resulting in UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
/
/During formation of the repeat unit, the nucleoside diphosphates are removed.
/The repeat unit is polymerized and attached to the outer core.  Formation and
/polymerization of the O-antigen repeat unit is not shown here as it is a complex
/macromolecular transformation which presently lies outside the scope of
/EcoCyc. |CITS: [7517391] [7512872] [ColiSalII]|

COMMENT - |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (UDP-GlcNAc) is an essential precursor of cell wall peptidoglycan,
/lipopolysaccharide and enterobacterial common antigen.  This situates UDP-GlcNAc at a branch point in metabolism,
/each fork leading to synthesis of a major envelope component of the cell |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.  The enzymes of these
/pathways are targets for development of novel antibacterial compounds (reviewed in |CITS: [17692001]|).
/
/|FRAME: L-GLN-FRUCT-6-P-AMINOTRANS-CPLX|, or GFAT, catalyzes the first committed step in UDP-GlcNAc
/biosynthesis from fructose-6-phosphate.  The product of this first reaction, |FRAME: D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P|, can
/also be transported into the cell and utilized as a source of carbon; thus, expression of GFAT is controlled at several
/levels.  For details on regulation and the mechanism of uncoupling it from the regulation of |FRAME: EG11198|
/expression, please see the protein page: |FRAME: L-GLN-FRUCT-6-P-AMINOTRANS-CPLX|.
/
/|FRAME: D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P| is then converted to |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINE-1P| by
/|FRAME: PHOSGLUCOSAMINEMUT-MONOMER|.  The two final reactions of the pathway, transfer of an acetyl group
/from acetyl-CoA to form |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-1-P| and transfer of a uridyl group to form the
/final product, UDP-GlcNAc, are carried out by a bifunctional enzyme, GlmU, which contains two domains that carry out
/each reaction independently.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential and ubiquitous cofactor occurring in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. 
/It is utilized both as a source of the phosphopantetheine moiety of certain proteins and as a carrier in a
/large number of reactions central to intermediary metabolism.  CoA is the acyl carrier required for reactions
/in both biosynthetic and degradative pathways, forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy
/metabolism.
/
/The biosynthesis of CoA was recognized as a target for antibacterial drug discovery.  Interest in the human
/pathway was sparked by the association of a neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in pantothenate
/kinase.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Pantothenate is the starting compound for the biosynthesis of CoA.  <i>E. coli</i> can synthesize
/pantothenate via the |FRAME: PANTO-PWY| pathway or import it from the medium via the
/|FRAME: PANF-MONOMER|.  Five enzymatic steps then convert pantothenate to CoA. 
/
/Pantothenate kinase first phosphorylates pantothenate to 4'-phosphopantothenate; the enzyme is feedback
/inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis.  The
/addition of cysteine, resulting in the formation of (R)-4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC), and the
/subsequent decarboxylation of PPC to 4'-phosphopantetheine, are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme. 
/The enzymatic activities can be separated, and indeed exist as two separately encoded enzymes in other
/organisms.  Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase finally convert
/4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA.
/
/All enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth of <i>E. coli</i>.

/and a specific lysine residue in the enzyme |CITS: [8444795]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of lipoate is unusual, and shares the same mechanism as the biosynthesis of biotin.
/
/The |FRAME: EG11796-MONOMER| (LplA) was initially described as acting only on lipoate that has
/been imported from outside the cell (see |FRAME: PWY0-522|) |CITS: [8002607]|.
/However, a new role for this enzyme was found
/following the observation that <i>E. coli</i> lipB mutants (defective in |FRAME:EG11591-MONOMER|)
/grew well with ocatanoate instead of lipoate.
/
/Octanoate growth required both |FRAME:EG11796-MONOMER| and |FRAME:CPLX0-782|, the enzyme
/that converts octanoyl side chains to lipoyl side chains, suggesting that |FRAME:EG11796-MONOMER|
/attached octanoate to the enzyme domain, and |FRAME:CPLX0-782| converted the octanoate to lipoate
/|CITS: [14700636]|.
/
/The first enzyme in this pathway, lipoyl-protein ligase, transfers octanoate to specific lysyl residues
/in lipoate-dependent enzymes, resulting in the formation of octanylated domains
/
/The next enzyme in the pathway, lipoate synthase, catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain
/to an active lipoyl, generating a fully active lipoylated domain.
/The enzyme is an iron-sulfur protein that requires the presence of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP),
/and the molecule S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) |CITS: [8444795][11106496]|.
/An electron which originates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme serves to split at least two
/molecules of AdoMet into a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine |CITS: [11834738]|.
/The radical then abstracts a hydrogen from a C-H bond of thew octanoyl side chain, becoming
/5'-adenosine in the process. 
/The newly-formed unstable octanoyl radical then reacts directly with the Fe-S center of the enzyme.
/Two sulfur atoms from the center enter the structure of the octanoyl side chain, producing lipoyl, which
/dissociates from the enzyme along with excess iron, leaving it with a [2Fe-2S] center.
/Thus, in this unusual reaction, the iron-sulfur center of the enzyme is not just a catalytic accelerator, but
/also a substrate, donating the two sulfur atoms |CITS: [11153271]|. 
/It should be noted that while this process has been well documented <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [11106496]|,
/there is still a possibility that there exists another sulfur donor <i>in vivo</i>, and that the Fe-S center
/acts as sulfur donor only in the absence of this natural donor |CITS: [11395404]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The pyridine nucleotide coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, formerly named DPN) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP, formerly named TPN) play key roles as cofactors in oxidation-reduction reactions in all living cells.  The nicotinamide ring functions as a prosthetic group for these reactions.  Their oxidized forms are depicted here as  NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> due to the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring.  Their reduced forms are referred to as NADH and NADPH.  Although they appear chemically equivalent, their metabolic roles differ.   NAD<sup>+</sup> is generally the cofactor for energy-producing oxidation reactions, while NADPH is the cofactor for reductive biosynthetic reactions.  The pentose phosphate pathway, the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme (Icd) and the PntAB transhydrogenase (see below) are important sources of NADPH (in |CITS: [14660605]|).
/
/Despite their importance, the regulation of NAD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation remains incompletely defined.  Earlier work on the kinetics of pyridine nucleotide metabolism in <i>Escherichia coli</i> demonstrated that the ratio of NADP to NAD results largely from the rates of NADP and NAD interconversion (in |CITS: [4146187]|).
/
/The reversible reduction of both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> is carried out by the two transhydrogenase isoforms shown in the reaction links.  The PntAB product of genes <i>pntA</i> and <i>pntB</i> is located in the inner membrane and also functions as a proton pump.  Its physiological function is to catalyze energy-dependent reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> with NADH.  The soluble product of gene <i>sthA</i> is thought to function mainly in the reoxidation of NADPH with NAD<sup>+</sup>.  The expression of these two isoforms is modulated by the redox state of cellular metabolism |CITS: [14660605]|.  In |CITS: [5543676]| and reviewed by Penfound, T. and J.W. Foster in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see below).  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/NAD kinases have been characterized in organisms from a variety of taxonomic groups including archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes (reviewed in |CITS: [18391451]|).  The NAD kinase of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> has been shown to be essential for growth |CITS: [16682646]| and evidence for its essentiality in <i>E. coli</i> has been presented |CITS: [12142426]|.
/
/In contrast, NADP phosphatases (NADPases) remain poorly characterized despite their important role.  Although an NAD kinase homolog in the archaeon <i>Methanococcus jannaschii</i> was shown to also have NADP phosphatase activity, NADP phosphatases from eubacterial and eukaryotic sources still require identification of the genes encoding them and further study of their enzymatic properties.  In <i>E. coli</i> the product of <i>cysQ</i> showed high NADP and NADPH phosphatase activities, but kinetic studies of the purified enzyme suggested that it is not the true NADP phosphatase of this organism.

COMMENT - Even though NAD molecules are not consumed during oxidation reactions, they have a relatively short half-life.
/For example, in <i>E. coli</i> the NAD<sup>+</sup> half-life is 90 minutes. Once enzymatically degraded, the
/pyrimidine moiety of the molecule can be recouped via the NAD salvage cycles.
/This pathway is used for two purposes: it recycles the internally degraded NAD products
/nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide (also known as nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN) and nicotinamide, and it is
/used for the assimilation of exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup>.
/
/Since the NAD<sup>+</sup> molecule is highly polar,

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine
/dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell. 
/Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.  Because
/of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds
/are often depicted as NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively.
/
/Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms.  In reactions where
/NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate.  During the
/reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> (or NADP<sup>+</sup>), the molecule acquires two electrons and one
/proton, while the second proton is released into the medium.  Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in
/the form:
/
/NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2H -> NADH + H<sup>+</sup>
/
/NAD is synthesized via two major pathway families in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the
/<i>de novo</i> pathway, and the salvage pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate <i>de novo</i> pathway, in which the nicotinate
/moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate |CITS: [11153263]|, while in eukaryotes, the <i>de novo</i>
/pathway starts with tryptophan |CITS: [12062417]| (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).
/
/The first attempt to elucidate a prokaryotic pathway to NAD was reported by Ortega and Brown in 1960
/|CITS: [13731310]|. They implicated (incorrectly) glycerol and a dicarboxylic acid as precursors in the
/synthesis of the pyridine ring of NAD in <i>E. coli</i>.  Subsequent work by Chandler et al.
/|CITS: [4321550]| established that L-aspartate is the dicarboxylic acid precursor.  Suzuki et al., in 1973,
/established that the three carbon precursor is dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and not glycerol
/|CITS: [4351074]|.  In addition, Andreoli et al. demonstrated that quinolinate was a key intermediate in this
/pathway |CITS: [14013029]|.  Eventually it became clear that quinolinate is indeed a precursor, not only in
/this pathway, but in all known NAD biosynthetic pathways.

COMMENT - Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
/are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis. <i>E. coli</i>
/derives its IPP and DMAPP from D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate via this
/pathway.
/
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield
/1-deoxy-D-xylylose 5-phosphate (DXP). DXP is then rearranged and reduced to
/generate the pathway's namesake compound, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP).
/In the third reaction MEP is 
/converted into 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol, which is subsequently
/phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methylerythritol
/2-phosphate. This product is then converted into 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate.
/This compound is then reduced to generate 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate.
/In the final step, this diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP
/This ratio is subsequently adjusted to 7:3 by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.
/Both IPP and DMAPP then become the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.  
/
/This pathway, which is not present in humans, is involved 
/in production of phosphate-containing antigens recognized by &gamma;-&delta; T lymphocytes |CITS: [11675382]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Siroheme is an iron-containing isobacteriochlorin, a modified tetrapyrrole similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll that was discovered in 1973 |CITS: [4583265]|. Siroheme is structurally and biosynthetically related to the corrin ring of vitamin B12. Siroheme is covalently coupled to an iron-sulfur cluster ([FeS]) to form an electronically integrated metallo-cofactor for delivering electrons to substrate. Siroheme is found as a prosthetic group of several enzymes, including sulfite and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia, respectively. 
/
/The two known siroheme-containing enzymes of <i>E. coli</i> are NADPH-dependent (assimilatory) |FRAME: SULFITE-REDUCT-CPLX|, which can also function as an assimilatory nitrite reductase and NADH-dependent (dissimilatory) |FRAME: NITRITREDUCT-CPLX| |CITS: [8994874]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, siroheme is derived from uroporphyrinogen III by (i) methylation of the tetrapyrrole ring at positions 1 and 3 to form precorrin 2, (ii) oxidation of precorrin 2 to the tetrahydroporphyrin sirodihydrochlorin by removal of two electrons, and (iii) chelation of Fe2+. 
/
/Methylation of rings A and B of uroporphyrinogen III to produce precorrin 2 effectively limits subsequent oxidation beyond the tetrahydroporphyrin (dihydrochlorin) state. Oxidation of precorrin 2 to sirodihydrochlorin produces a compound that has the aromaticity and metal-binding properties necessary for efficient chelation of Fe2+.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, <i>cysG</i> is the only gene that encodes uroporphyrinogen methyltransferase. The <i>E. coli</i> <i>cysG</i> product is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes all steps of the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to siroheme in the enteric bacteria, and the enzyme has been named siroheme synthase.

COMMENT - Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins.  It is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles.
/It is biosynthesized as protoheme, but different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|, |FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.
/
/This superpathway shows the two routes of synthesis found in the facultative anaerobe E. coli. Under aerobic conditions, the transition from |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN| is catalyzed by the oxygen -dependent |FRAME: COPROGENOXI-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.3.3). However, when oxygen is not available, the organism is still able to catalyze this transition, using the readical-SAM enzyme |FRAME: HEMN-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.99.22), which can catalyze the transition without the need for molecular oxygen. This enzyme, which contains an iron-sulfur cluster, is able to break SAM into |FRAME: MET| and a 5'-deoxyadenosineyl radical. This radical can attack |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| and bring about the conversion to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN|.
/
/This enzyme is found in many bacteria, but does not appear to be present in archaea or eukarya (the only reference for the enzyme in a eukaryote is in the organism |FRAME: TAX-5911|, but this finding is based on sequence analysis alone, and has not been verified biochemically).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone (Q) as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone (MK) and/or demthylmenaquinone (DMK) as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain MK or DMK as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, contain Q, MK, and DMK, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|.
/
/DMKs are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism. The most common DMKs contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units. <i>E. coli</i> has demthylmenaquinone-8 (DMK-8) |CITS: [6406647]|, which is one of the major quinones in this organism. DMK-8 is a low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane and functions as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes. It is essentially an intermediate in MK formation (see |FRAME: PWY-5838|) |CITS: [11153266]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of DMK-8 is essentially identical to that of menaquinone-8 (MK-8). DMK-8 is methylated at the naphthoquinone ring to MK-8 by a methyltransferase, which uses S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The conversion of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) to DMK-8 in extracts of <i>E. coli</i> is catalyzed by a membrane-bound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-octaprenyltransferase (MenA). The conversion of DHNA to DMK requires replacement of the carboxyl with the isoprenoid side chain. Prenylation and decarboxylation may occur in a single active site, since symmetry experiments exclude 1,4-naphthoquinone as an intermediate. Moreover, there has been no evidence for two separate reaction steps or enzymes. A carbocation mechanism based on the dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase reaction has been proposed for the reaction.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) is a branch point metabolite leading to the biosynthesis of menaquinone (vitamin K2 in bacteria), phylloquinone (vitamin K1 in plants), and many plant pigments, including some two-ring naphthoquinones (such as lawsone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) and the three-ring anthraquinones (such as alizarin and munjistin). Many of these pigments were used as dyes since the early human history. Menaquinone (MK) or vitamin K2 is an essential nutrient for mammals as they are unable to synthesize it.  
/
/The benzenoid ring (or A ring) of DHNA is derived from chorismate, via all the intermediates of the shikimate pathway, including isochorismate. The quinone ring (or B ring) of DHNA is formed by addition of 2-oxoglutarate. The prenyl side chain on the nucleus is derived from prenyl PPi, and the methyl groups are derived from S-adenosylmethionine.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, addition of succinic semialdehyde-TPP anion (from 2-oxoglutarate) to isochorismate results in the formation of 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate (SEPHCHC). In the subsequent reaction, the pyruvoyl group is eliminated, resulting in the prearomatic compound (1<i>R</i>,6<i>R</i>)-6-hydroxy-2-succinylcyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC). This is then aromatized to the benzenoid aromatic compound o-succinylbenzoate (OSB) and used as the framework for the construction of the rest of the molecule. In this pathway, prenylation in the last step leads to the formation of DHNA. Subsequently OSB and DHNA formed in this pathway are incorporated into the naphthoquinone ring of menaquinone. 
/
/In <i> E. coli</i>, DHNA is required under anaerobic conditions. All the enzymes in this pathway are soluble.
/
/The enzyme isochorismate synthase (MenF) catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate. 
/
/The formation of SHCHC from isochorismate and 2-oxoglutarate is a two-step process requiring two different enzymes. The first enzyme SEPHCHC synthase (MenD) decarboxylates the 2-oxoglutarate and adds the resulting succinic semialdehyde anion of TPP to isochorismate, resulting in the formation of SEPHCHC.  SEPHCHC is an unstable compound and in mildly basic solutions, spontaneously undergoes a 2,5-elimination reaction resulting in the formation SHCHC and pyruvate. But the in vivo conversion of SEPHCHC to SHCHC is carried out by SHCHC synthase MenH. 
/
/Dehydration from SHCHC by the enzyme OSB synthase (MenC) leads to the formation of the benzenoid aromatic compound OSB. 
/
/The conversion of the benzenoid aromatic compound OSB to the naphthalenoid aromatic compound DHNA is catalyzed by the enzyme OSB-CoA synthetase (MenE). The process showed an absolute requirement for ATP and CoA. OSB-CoA is suggested as an intermediate. During the formation of OSB-CoA, ATP is hydrolyzed to AMP and PPi. 
/
/The enzyme MenB catalyzes the cyclization of OSB-CoA to DHNA-CoA. The enzyme responsible for the conversion of DHNA-CoA to DHNA remains to be identified. Reviewed in Meganathan, R. and O.

COMMENT - Ubiquinone is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in the membrane.  The quinone nucleus of
/ubiquinone is derived directly from chorismate, and the isoprenoid subuntis of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized
/via the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| which feeds isoprene units into the |FRAME: POLYISOPRENSYN-PWY|
/pathway.  Ubiquinone biosynthesis has primarily been elucidated by the use of mutant strains that accumulate
/pathway intermediates; many of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.
/
/The first committed step of the pathway is the conversion of chorismate to |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate| by
/|FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER|.  The enzyme retains and is efficiently inhibited by the product of the reaction,
/4-hydroxybenzoate, which may present a control mechanism for the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway or a
/mechanism for delivery of 4-hydroxybenzoate to the membrane |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.
/
/The second step in the pathway is the transfer of the polyisoprenoid tail onto |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate| by the
/membrane-bound |FRAME: 4OHBENZOATE-OCTAPRENYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|.  This is followed by the
/decarboxylation of the ring structure by |FRAME: CPLX0-301| (or possibly by UbiX) to form
/|FRAME: 2-OCTAPRENYLPHENOL|.  Under anaerobic conditions, this compound accumulates in the membrane and
/is not converted into ubiquinone.  Further steps in the pathway require the presence of dioxygen |CITS: [361395]|.
/
/Following is the alternating introduction of three hydroxyl- and three methyl groups.  With the exception of the
/methyltransferase that catalyzes both of the <i>O</i>-methyltransferase reactions, UbiG, none of the enzymes have
/been studied biochemically.  The reactions catalyzed by the three hydroxylases are particularly intriguing, but again
/none of them have been studied biochemically; thus, their substrate and cofactor requirements are unknown.
/
/The enzymes of this pathway may form a membrane-associated complex |CITS: [393264]|.  UbiX shows a genetic
/interaction with UbiG, suggesting a possible physical interaction within a complex |CITS: [16923914]|.
/
/Under anaerobic conditions, alternate enzymes must perform the hydroxylation steps that are carried out by UbiB,
/UbiH, and UbiF under aerobic conditions.  No enzymes of the proposed anaerobic pathway have been identified

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Thiols are compounds that play a major role in the detoxification of stress-inducing factors.  The tripeptide glutathione (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly, GSH) is generally the major component of the non-protein thiol fraction in the cell.  Pathogenic bacteria live in a particularly hostile environment, in which the host deliberately generates toxins, including reactive oxygen species, to destroy the invading organism.  Thus thiols are particularly important for the survival of these organisms.  GSH is a component of the thiol redox system, which controls the redox state of cytoplasmic cysteine residues.  In <i>E. coli</i>, a specific target is ribonucleotide reductase.
/
/While GSH is the major thiol in eukaryotes, Gram-negative bacteria and the majority of Gram-positive bacteria, it is not universal.  In some organisms other thiols have taken its role, including |FRAME: CoM|, |FRAME: TRYPANOTHIONE|, ergothioneine, |FRAME: CPD1G-2| and the ovothiols.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The thiol redox system of <i>Escherichia coli</i> consists of the thioredoxin pathway (shown here) and the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway (see |FRAME: GLUT-REDOX-PWY|).  Electrons from NADPH flow through these pathways via gradients in redox potentials.  Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin reduce disulfide bonds by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism involving two active site cysteine residues in the motif CXXC (where X is any amino acid) that form either a disulfide or a dithiol.  In addition to the importance of thiol redox potential |CITS: [10464247]|, other important factors in the thiol redox system are cellular location |CITS: [9724776]| and the overall redox state of the cell.  Both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways appear to operate in parallel.  Genetic studies in <i>E. coli</i> have shown the two pathways to be functionally redundant during aerobic growth, although inactivation of both pathways results in unviability.

/The thioredoxin pathway is involved in reducing important cytoplasmic enzymes such as the essential ribonucleotide reductase, as well as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase and methionine sulfoxide reductases A and B.  <i>E. coli</i> thioredoxin also binds to bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and serves as its processivity factor for polymerization during phage growth  (|CITS: [20080681]| and in |CITS: [9440688]|).  In addition, many other proteins that may interact with thioredoxin have been identified |CITS: [15502869] [15004283]|.  Thioredoxin is also involved in a pathway for the trans-membrane transfer of reducing potential from the cytoplasm to the periplasm to reduce the protein disulfide isomerase DbsC |CITS: [9352906] [19258316]|.  After acting as a reductant, disulfide-containing oxidized thioredoxin is reduced back to a dithiol by thioredoxin reductase, an FAD-containing, NADPH-dependent enzyme.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Tetrapyrroles are compounds whose molecules have four rings of the pyrrole type, generally linked together by single-atom bridges between the alpha positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings. Tetrapyrroles function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.
/
/The biosynthesis of all of these cofactors start in a similar manner, with the production of the intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III. This intermediate is an important branch point: its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or cofactor F430 synthesis, while decarboxylation directs it toward the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll |CITS: [14633982]|. 
/
/The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway shown here, which starts with glutamate, is found in plants, many bacteria (including <i>Escherichia coli</i>), and the archaea. A second tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, which is found in animals, fungi, certain protozoans, and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, starts with glycine and succinyl-coA (see |FRAME:PWY-5189|). 
/
/Regardless whether the starting point is glycine or glutamate, both pathways converge at the intermediate 5-amino-levulinate and proceed through the important intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III, which is a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of different tetrapyrrole compounds, such as the corrinoid cobalamine (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), the methanogenic coenzyme F<sub>430</sub> (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|),  |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|, and heme D.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) can be considered to be the first universal, committed tetrapyrrole precursor. This pathway is called the five-carbon pathway because ALA is formed from the intact five-carbon skeleton of glutamate (glu). In <i>E. coli</i> the transformation of glu to ALA consists of three enzyme-catalyzed steps. In the first step, glu is activated by ligation to tRNA in a reaction identical to the tRNA-charging reaction in protein biosynthesis, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GltX). Like aminoacyl-tRNA formation, this reaction requires ATP and Mg2+. Next, the glu is converted to a reduced form in a reaction that requires a reduced pyridine nucleotide, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (HemA). The product of this reduction has been characterized as glu 1-semialdehyde (GSA). Finally, the positions of the nitrogen and oxo atoms of the reduced five-carbon intermediate are interchanged to form ALA, catalyzed by the enzyme GSA aminotransferase (HemL). 
/
/Porphobilinogen (PBG) synthase (HemB) catalyzes the asymmetric condensation of two ALA molecules to form PBG, with the release of two molecules of water. The amino group of this ALA molecule is a critical component of the binding site for the other ALA molecule. During the formation of PBG, removal of hydrogen to form the aromatic pyrrole ring must occur on the enzyme, as is indicated by the stereospecific retention the hydrogen atom that is derived from the pro-S C5 hydrogen of ALA. The reaction requires no external energy source. <i>E. coli</i> PBG synthase requires Zn2+ for activity. 
/
/Uroporphyrinogen III, the last common precursor of all end product tetrapyrroles, is synthesized from PBG by the sequential action of two enzymes, hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) synthase (HemC) and uroporphyrinogen III synthase (HemD). HMB synthase condenses four PBG molecules to form the first tetrapyrrole, HMB. The released product, free HMB, rapidly cyclizes spontaneously and irreversibly to form the nonphysiological product uroporphyrinogen I. Biosynthesis of the biologically relevant isomer, uroporphyrinogen III, requires the presence of a second enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, during or immediately after release of HMB.
/
/An initially puzzling report showed that <i>E. coli</i> <i>hemB</i> mutant cells, which were unable to form active PBG synthase, were also deficient in HMB synthase activity unless PBG was supplied in the medium.  Finally, highly purified recombinant E. coli HMB synthase was discovered to contain a covalently bound dipyrromethane (dipyrrole) that is an essential cofactor for enzyme activity. The cofactor is synthesized from HMB and is ligated to a Cys residue (C242 of the <i>E. coli</i> enzyme). Once bound, the dipyrrole cofactor remains permanently attached to the enzyme, and its free &alpha;-position serves as a ligand for oligomerization of PBG substrate units to form the tetrapyrrole product. Scission of the link between the cofactor and the nascent oligopyrrole chain after the hexapyrrole stage is reached releases HMB and prepares the enzyme-bound dipyrrole cofactor to accept new substrate molecules. The existence of the dipyrrole cofactor explains the previously reported requirement for PBG to obtain active hydroxymethylbilane synthase in <i>hemB</i> mutant <i>E. coli</i> cells.

COMMENT - |FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is an essential cofactor for carboxyl group transfer enzymes such as
/|FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|. 
/
/Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years. The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in E. coli |CITS: [20693992]|.
/
/Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, describe the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.
/
/The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in E. coli are known from <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis of products labeled <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|. The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate. The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|. This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|. As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.
/
/The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicate in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.
/Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [Indrajit94][13930373]|. An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]|. Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 "BioC"| converts the free carboxyl group of a |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| thioester to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|.The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: CPD-12454| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.
/
/Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters "pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester"|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 "BioH"| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs "pimeloyl-[acp]"|. The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 "BioF"|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly.
/
/The next step in the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: EG10117|-encoded |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|. This product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, the |FRAME: EG10120|-encoded |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|. This enzye catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.
/
/The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10118|.
/This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.  It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the
/source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|. However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.
/
/According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway. When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.
/
/An <i>in vitro</i> system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|.

COMMENT - The biosynthesis of |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE| from |FRAME:CPD-691| requires the
/attachment of an aminopropanol group to the propionate side chain of the
/corrin ring.
/Isotope studies with cultures of microorganisms that biosynthesize vitamin B12
/have clearly shown that the amino group and carbon chain of this piece of cobalamin are both
/derived from L-threonine |CITS: [13416277]|.
/
/Initial work suggested that |FRAME: 1-AMINO-PROPAN-2-OL| might be formed from L-threonine by
/sequential action of two distinct enzymes, namely |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| and
/|FRAME:AMINOPROPDEHYDROG-ENZRXN| |CITS: [4577583]|.
/These two enzymes have been purified from |FRAME:ECOLI| and were shown to catalyze the proposed
/reactions in vitro |CITS: [359547]|. The second enzyme was later shown to be identical with
/|FRAME: ENZRXN0-6324| |CITS: [3920199]|.
/
/Later work, performed with |FRAME: TAX-90371|, suggested that the the actual substrate for the CbiB
/enzyme, proposed to convert |FRAME:CPD-691| to |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE|, 
/is actually  |FRAME:R-1-AMINOPROPAN-2-YL-PHOSPHATE| rather than
/|FRAME:1-AMINO-PROPAN-2-OL| (see |FRAME:PWY-5443|) |CITS: [9446573]|.

TYPES - Folate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - formylTHF biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Folates are tripartite molecules comprising pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pABA), and glutamate moieties. In natural folates the pterin ring exists in the dihydro or tetrahydro state. Folate usually has a gamma-linked polyglutamyl tail of up to eight residues attached to the first glutamate. The one-carbon units (methyl or formyl) are either attached to the N-5 of the pterin moiety, to the N-10 of the pABA moiety or bridged in between these two (e.g., 5,10-methenyl or methylene-THF). 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolates are involved in tetrahydrofolate, purine and formate synthesis |CITS: [7868604] [17645794]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The formation of the formyl and methyl derivatives of tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) directly involved in or representing sidesteps of the biosynthesis of this vital cofactor is displayed in this pathway. Conversion of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate occurs either directly through hydrolysis or via 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate in several steps |CITS: [7868604] [17645794]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The various folate coenzymes are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor 
/molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. 
/They also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, and play a role in histidine catabolism 
/|CITS: [11001804]|. 
/
/Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons)
/of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.
/
/Tetrahydrofolate (tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate, H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, THF), is merely the parent 
/structure of this large family of coenzymes. Native folates differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the
/character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions, and the number of glutamic acid moieties 
/conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has two metabolic routes for the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate. 
/The first route is the <i>de novo</i> synthesis pathway, which  begins with GTP and requires the activities of the
/proteins encoded by the genes <i>folE, folB, folK, folP, fol C</i> and <i>folA</i>.   
/The first committed step catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase I converts GTP into dihydroneopterin triphosphate. 
/The triphosphate motif is removed by a still unknown process, and the resulting 7,8-dihydro-D-neopterin 
/is converted to 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin by dihydroneopterin aldolase (FolB). 
/The consecutive action of the FolK, FolP, FolC, and FolA enzymes finally produces the final product,
/6-(S)-tetrahydrofolate |CITS: [12039964]|.
/
/A second pathway is a folate salvage pathway, which is used to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from
/breakdown products of folates in the cell, such as 5 or 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.

COMMENT - Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and 
/mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states.
/These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, 
/formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. 
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme
/|FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATESYNTH-ENZRXN| (encoded in <i>E. coli</i> by |FRAME:EG10327|) adds a glutamate
/residue to 7,8-dihydropteroate, resulting in 7,8-dihydrofolate, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>.
/This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:DIHYDROFOLATEREDUCT-ENZRXN|
/(FolA) to tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or THF).
/THF can then be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming
/folate polyglutamtes (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates).  Most of the glutamates are added by 
/&gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate 
/or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by 
/peptidases or proteases that are specific for  &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide  bonds. 
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized 
/dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/Apparently, the glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, 
/it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in 
/mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis 
/|CITS: [10598551]|.
/Folylpolyglutamates are generally better substrates for folate-dependent enzymes than their monoglutamyl 
/counterparts. Km values decrease with increasing oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain length |CITS: [2688305]|.
/At least in one case, the vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-independent methionine synthetase, there is an absolute 
/requirement for the polyglutamate cofactor |CITS: [2985605]|.
/
/In addition, many folate enzymes are multifunctional and channel one-carbon units between reactions without 
/achieving equilibrium with the cell medium. Therefore, the conjugated oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl chain 
/can potentially regulate the reaction rates, and allows channeling of the substrate between enzymes in a way which 
/controls biosynthetic pathways |CITS: [2688305]|.
/
/
/Folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of folates to 
/polyglutamates, has been purified from several organisms, including <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [2985605]|.
/It is a MgATP-dependent enzyme present in all cells. FPGS forms a complex with MgATP, a folate derivative, 
/and glutamate, in an ordered manner whereby the three substrates are added sequentially |CITS: [11501996]|. 
/In <i>E. coli</i>, FPGS is a bi-functional enzyme, which also catalyzes the addition of glutamate 
/to 7,8-dihydropteroate, generating 7,8,-dihydrofolate (dihydrofolate synthetase, (E.C# 6.3.2.12). 
/
/In exponentially growing cells of <i>E. coli</i> folylpoly-&gamma;- glutamates have short glutamate chain lengths: 
/mono- and triglutamate derivatives are most abundant, with tetra-, penta- and hexaglutamate derivatives 
/also present (in order of decreasing abundance). However, in stationary phase, cells contain longer-chain-length 
/folypolyglutamates, with the predominant chain length containing six or seven  glutamyl residues.
/These longer chains are generated by a second enzyme, which adds glutamate moieties in &alpha;-linkage to 
/tetrahydropteroyl- triglutamates |CITS: [3536926]|. However, this enzyme has not been purified, 
/nor has the gene encoding it been identified. 
/
/Both folylpolyglutamate synthetases can accept several different folate derivatives as substrates. It seems that
/the preferred substrate for the addition of a second glutamate residue is 10-formyl-THF 
/(10-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>), while the preferred substrate for the addition of a third glutamate
/residue is the glutamated form of 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-methylene-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>2</sub>).

TYPES - Pantothenate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - phosphopantothenate biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - 7037743:EV-EXP:3415467384:keseler
COMMENT - Pantothenate (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>) is the universal precursor for the synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine
/moiety of |FRAME:CO-A| and acyl carrier protein.  Only plants and microorganisms (including some eukaryotic
/microbes, such as |FRAME: TAX-559292|) can synthesize pantothenate <i>de novo</i> - animals require a dietary
/supplement.  The enzymes of this pathway are therefore considered to be antimicrobial drug targets.
/
/The starting compound for pantothenate biosynthesis, |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, is derived from the
/|FRAME: VALSYN-PWY| pathway.  The first committed step in the pathway is the transfer of a methyl group to
/2-keto-isovalerate by |FRAME: 3-METHYL-2-OXOBUT-OHCH3XFER-CPLX|.  The product of this reaction,
/|FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE|, is subsequently reduced by
/|FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE-REDUCT-MONOMER| to |FRAME: L-PANTOATE|.  The final step is the ATP
/hydrolysis-dependent condensation of L-pantoate with |FRAME: B-ALANINE| to form |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE|,
/which is catalyzed by |FRAME: PANTOATE-BETA-ALANINE-LIG-CPLX|.
/
/The enzymes of this pathway are not essential for viability of <i>E. coli</i> grown on media supplemented with
/pantothenate due to the presence of a transporter for pantothenate, PanF |CITS: [2193919]|.
/
/Evolution of this pathway from a perspective of the structure of its enzymes has been investigated |CITS: [12773157]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) or vitamin B<sub>6</sub>. PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors that participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. This vitamin has a role in numerous human body functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to its recent discovery as a potent antioxidant. Its <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis occurs only in bacteria, fungi and plants, making it an essential nutrient in the human diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of this vitamin was thoroughly studied in <i>E. coli</i> and involves two branches with seven enzymatic steps. In one branch, the sequential action of the enzymes Epd, PdxB and SerC results in the convesrion of erythrose 4-phosphate into 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine. The latter then undergoes oxidation and decarboxylation by PdxA to form 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate. In the other branch, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) is derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate by the action of Dxs. The products of the two branches, i.e. 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and DXP, are then condensed by PdxJ to form PNP, which enters the salvage pathway to undergo oxidation by PdxH to form the PLP cofactor.
/
/From the six pdx genes, two of them, <i>epd</i> and <i>serC</i>, are involved in other metabolic processes, but <i>pdxA</i>, <i>pdxB</i>, <i>pdxJ</i> and <i>pdxH</i> are unique for PLP biosynthesis |CITS: [1537800]|. PdxJ, the PNP synthase is the key ezyme that catalyzes a multistep ring closure yielding PNP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This is the last step in the <i>de novo</i> synthetic pathway.
/
/An alternative and recently discovered DXP-independent pathway for PNP biosynthesis begins with glutamine in other micro-organisms and is very similar both structurally and mechanistically to the one in <i>E. coli</i>. 
/

/Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typically consist of a hydrophobic domain inserted into the outer membrane known as lipid A (or endotoxin), a phosphorylated "core" oligosaccharide and a distal polysaccharide (or O antigen). The core oligosaccharides are conceptually divided into two regions: inner core and outer core. The inner core is highly conserved, comprises three deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) and is often phosphorylated. The inner core oligosaccharide plays a critical role in essential barrier function of the outer membrane. The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. The outer core provides an attachment site for O-antigen. Strains of <i>E. coli</i> K12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|.

/The completed lipid A-KDO<sub>2</sub> serves as the acceptor on which the core oligosaccharide chains are assembled by sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors. This process involves a co-ordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases acting at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Many of the enzymes are predicted to be peripheral proteins.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are unique and complex glycolipids that provide characteristic components of the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Wild type LPS is composed of a hydrophobic domain lipid A (or endotoxin), a phosphorylated "core" oligosaccharide (core OS) and a distal O-specific polysaccharide (or O-antigen). Strains of <I>E. coli</I> K-12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|. O antigens are not needed for growth in the laboratory, but they protect bacteria from antibiotics and complement-mediated lysis. The lipid A and Kdo domains of LPS are required for growth |CITS: [17362200][12045108]|. 
/
/The lipid A (endotoxin) domain of LPS is a unique, glucosamine-based saccharolipid that serves as the hydrophobic anchor of LPS. It is the bioactive component of the molecule that is associated with gram-negative septic shock |CITS: [15052329]|. There are approximately 10<sup>6</sup> lipid A residues in an <i>E. coli</i> cell |CITS: [17362200]|. Lipid A of <i>E. coli</i> consists of a &beta; (1'->6)-linked D-glucosamine disaccharide that carries four (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl groups in positions 2, 3, 2', and 3' and two phosphoryl residues in positions 1 and 4'. The hydroxy fatty acids at positions 2' and 3' are acylated at their 3-hydroxyl groups by dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid, respectively |CITS: [3317748]|. Given their conserved architecture, most types of lipid A molecules are detected at picomolar levels by TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) of the innate immune system present on macrophages and endothelial cells of animals |CITS: [12045108]|.
/
/The core oligosaccharides are conceptually divided into two regions: the inner core (lipid A proximal) and the outer core. The inner core is highly conserved. It comprises three 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) residues and it is often phosphorylated. Structural diversity in the core oligosaccharide is limited by the constraints imposed by its essential role in outer membrane stability |CITS: [12935355][9791168]|. <i>E. coli</i> mutants that lack the heptose region of the inner core display the "deep rough" phenotype characterized by changes in both the structure and the composition of the outer membrane leading to its instability |CITS: [385128]|. Deep rough mutants of <i>E. coli</i> activate expression of colanic acid exopolysaccharide, lose expression of pili and flagella and secrete a form of hemolysin with reduced hemolytic activity |CITS: [1348243]|. The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. The outer core region provides an attachment site for O antigen |CITS: [9791168]|. Mutations that eliminate synthesis of the outer core result in increased susceptibility to some hydrophobic compounds due to an indirect effect on core phosphorylation |CITS: [2168379]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> lipid A is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane by a conserved pathway of nine constitutive enzymes. The first reaction of lipid A biosynthesis is the acylation of the sugar nucleotide UDP-GlcNAc by LpxA. Deacetylation of the product, UDP-3-O-(acyl)-GlcNAc by the zinc metalloenzyme LpxC is the committed reaction of the pathway. LpxC is an excellent target for the design of novel, gram-negative specific antibiotics. Following deacetylation, a second beta-hydroxymyristate moiety is incorporated by LpxD to generate UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine. UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is cleaved at its pyrophosphate bond by the highly selective pyrophosphatase LpxH to form 2,3-diacylglucosamine-1-phosphate (lipid X). A beta,1'-6 linked disaccharide is then generated by the condensation of another molecule of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine with lipid X by LpxB. A specific kinase, LpxK next phosphorylates the 4' position of the disaccharide to form lipid IVA. The kinase product, lipid IVA, is of great interest because it possesses some of the properties of endotoxins |CITS: [12045108]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> LPS contains two Kdo residues that are transferred to lipid IVA by a bifunctional enzyme, encoded by <i>waaA</i>. The chromosomal waa region (formerly rfa) contains the major core-oligosaccharide assembly operons, and <i>E. coli</i> K-12 provided the first waa region sequenced in its entirety |CITS: [12935355]|. The last steps of <i>E. coli</i> lipid A biosynthesis involve the addition of lauroyl and myristoyl residues to the distal glucosamine unit (generating acyloxyacyl moieties by LpxL and LpxM respectively. The completed lipid A-Kdo2 serves as the acceptor on which the core oligosaccharide and lipo-oligosaccharide chains are assembled. 
/
/The lipid A-core portion (known as rough LPS (R-LPS)) is synthesized by a conserved pathway. The mechanism involves sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors with a co-coordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases (Waa proteins) acting at the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane (IM). The modification of the core region of <i>E. coli</i> LPS requires the action of three enzymes, <i>viz.</i> WaaP (an LPS kinase), WaaY (an enzyme required for a second phosphorylation) and WaaQ (a transferase that adds the side-branch heptose). The WaaP enzyme is the most important of these activities since the modifications must proceed in the strict order WaaPQY. Mutants lacking WaaP activity exhibit the deep rough phenotype and are avirulent. Mutant LPSs lacking the outer core (<i>waaG</i>) are phosphorylated inefficiently by WaaP |CITS: [10986272]|. Conversely, the loss of phosphorylation results in a decreased efficiency of core extension, leading to more truncated cores than seen in the wild type. 
/
/The lipid A-core is then flipped to the outer surface of the inner membrane by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, MsbA. An additional integral membrane protein, YhjD, has recently been implicated in LPS export across the IM. The smallest LPS derivative that supports viability in <i>E. coli</i> is lipid IVA. However, it requires mutations in either MsbA or YhjD, to suppress the normally lethal consequence of an incomplete lipid A |CITS: [18480051]|. Recent studies with deletion mutants implicate the periplasmic protein LptA, the cytosolic protein LptB, and the IM proteins LptC, LptF, and LptG in the subsequent transport of nascent LPS to the outer membrane (OM), where the LptD/LptE complex flips LPS to the outer surface |CITS: [18768814]|.

COMMENT - This pathway shows the reactions that constitute one turn of a cycle that lengthens the chain of an acyl-ACP 
/molecule by two carbons. The pathway is fed acetoacetyl-ACP (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) 
/which  is a substrate of the second reaction shown here. The products of multiple turns of this cycle that are drawn 
/off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds such as phospholipids, lipid A, and lipoproteins are 
/the saturated fatty acids , lauric (dodecanoic), myristic (tetradecanoic), palmitic (hexadecanoic), and stearic 
/(octadecanoic) acids. <i>E. coli </i> also contains unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed by a pathway
/(see |FRAME:PWY0-862|) that branches at the level of the 10-carbon intermediate.
/|CITS: [14527277]| |CITS: [8246839]|.
/The final step of the cycle, the reductase, once thought to be catalyzed by two enzymes, has been 
/shown to be catalyzed by a single enzyme, FabI, that can use either NADH or NADPH as a substrate |CITS: [9022698]|.
/
/Of the four reactions involved in a cycle of fatty-acid elongation, two are catalyzed by more that one enzyme. These 
/function preferentially on substrates of different chain length. They also act differentially on saturated and unsaturated
/ substrates |CITS: [8910376]|. The first reaction in the sequence, the condensation reaction, is catalyzed by three 
/enzymes, FabB, FabF, and FabH. FabH initiates fatty-acid synthesis: it uses only acetyl-ACP as a substrate 
/(see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) |CITS: [14523010]|. Only FabB catalyzes one step in the synthesis 
/of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [11566998]|  The activity of FabF and hence the fraction of fatty acids that are 
/unsaturated in modultated by temperature. The distribution of the flow of synthesis that proceeds to saturated 
/vs. unsaturated fatty acids is determined by the activities of FabA and FabZ |CITS: [8910376]|.

Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of a holo-[acp].
/
/The best-studied pathway is that of <i>E. coli</i> K-12, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystallized |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequnce, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, and this pathway describes the major route. In it, one acetyl-CoA molecule is converted to malonyl-CoA, which is then activated to malonyl-ACP that is condensed with a second acetyl-CoA molecule to form acetoacetyl-ACP.
/
/The first enzyme in this pathway, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, is the controlling point for the flux of carbon into lipids. It is a biotin-containing multi-enzyme complex with two activities, |FRAME: BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX| and |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, catalyzing two half reactions that combined condense bicarbonate with acetyl-CoA to yield malonyl-CoA. Further discussion of this enzyme is available in the pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1264|.
/
/The malonyl-CoA is next attached to a holo-[acp] by the enzyme malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase.
/
/The last step of the pathway, the condensation of a second acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP, is carried out by the condensing enzyme &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS). <i>E. coli</i> has three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases: KASI, KASII and KASIII encoded by <i>fabB</i>, <i>fabF</i> and <i>fabH</i> respectively. 
/
/KASIII is the key enzyme in the initiation of fatty acids biosynthesis. It selectively catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP and specifically uses CoA thioesters rather than acyl-ACP as the primer. The products tend to be shorter than the products of KASI and II, which are involved primarily in elongation reactions. Unlike the other two enzymes, KASIII cannot participate in the terminal elongation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS: [15952903]|.
/
/KASIII is inhibited by long-chain acyl-ACPs, indicating a role in feedback regulation of fatty acid synthesis. Since it catalyzes the first condensation step in fatty acid synthesis, it is able to control the rate of fatty acid initiation.
/
/The substrate specificity of KASIII is a major determining factor in membrane fatty acid composition of an organism. In <i>E. coli</i> the enzyme is highly selective for acetyl-CoA, and thus only straight-chain fatty acids are produced in this organism. |CITS:[10629181]|.
/
/Other potential routes for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are described in |FRAME: PWY-5966| and |FRAME: PWY-5965|.

COMMENT - The pathway of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids branches from the pathway leading to saturated
/fatty acids at |FRAME: Beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACPs|. Two dehydratases, FabA and FabZ, function
/for the most part interchangeably in converting |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP| of various chain lengths,
/saturated or unsaturated, to the corresponding |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP| unsaturated forms.
/But FabA has the unique ability of converting some of the |FRAME: Trans-D2-decenoyl-ACPs|
/produced to |FRAME: Cis-delta-3-decenoyl-ACPs|.
/The <i>trans</i> form is subsequently reduced and stays in the pathway leading to saturated fatty acids.
/However, the <i>cis</i>-form cannot be reduced. Instead it serves directly as a substrate for the
/condensing enzyme, FabB, and the subsequent three reactions shown here that lengthen the chain
/by two carbon atoms. As might be predicted, mutant strains unable to produce active FabA are unable
/to make unsaturated fatty acids, but make a normal complement of saturated fatty acids.
/
/Repeated cycling of these four elongation reactions eventually lead to the unsaturated fatty acids,
/|FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247|, that are incorporated into various lipids.
/<i>E.coli</i> produces greater amounts of |FRAME: CPD-9247| when grown at lower temperature.
/This modulation is effected by one condensing enzyme, FabF, that initiates elongation of
/|FRAME: CPD-9245| to form |FRAME: CPD-9247|; it is activated at low temperature.

COMMENT - This pathway shows the generation of acetoacetyl-ACP which feeds in to the pathway of elongation of saturated 
/fatty acids.
/
/The cycles of elongation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid involve the same reactions. The branch from the 
/saturated to the unsaturated pathway occurs when the chain length is 10 carbon atoms.
/
/The pathway of elongation of saturated fatty shows the reactions that constitute one turn of a cycle that lengthens 
/the chain of an acyl-ACP molecule by two carbons. The products of multiple turns 
/of this cycle that are drawn off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds such as phospholipids, 
/lipid A, and lipoproteins are the saturated fatty acids , lauric (dodecanoic), myristic (tetradecanoic), palmitic 
/(hexadecanoic), and stearic (octadecanoic) acids. <i>E. coli </i> also contains unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed 
/by a pathway (Pathway: fatty acid elongation -- unsaturated) that branches at the level of the 10-carbon 
/intermediate. |CITS: [14527277], [8246839]|. The final step of the cycle, the reductase, once thought to be 
/catalyzed by two enzymes, has been shown to be catalyzed by a single enzyme, FabI, that can use either NADH or 
/NADPH as a substrate |CITS: [9022698]|.
/
/Of the four reactions involved in a cycle of fatty-acid elongation, two are catalyzed by more that one enzyme. These 
/function preferentially on substrates of different chain length. They also act differentially on saturated and unsaturated 
/substrates |CITS: [8910376]|. The first reaction in the sequence, the condensation reaction, is catalyzed by 
/three enzymes, FabB, FabF, and FabH. FabH initiates fatty-acid synthesis: it uses only acetyl-ACP as a substrate 
/(see Pathway: fatty acid biosynthesis?initial steps) |CITS: [14523010]|. Only FabB catalyzes one step in the synthesis 
/of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [11566998]|.  The activity of FabF and hence the fraction of fatty acids that are 
/unsaturated in modultated by temperature (ref). The distribution of the flow of synthesis that proceeds to saturated 
/vs. unsaturated fatty acids is determined by the activities of FabA and FabZ |CITS: [8910376]|.
/ also contains unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed 
/by a pathway (Pathway: fatty acid elongation -- unsaturated) that branches at the level of the 10-carbon intermediate
/|CITS: [14527277], [8246839]|. The final step of the cycle, the reductase, once thought to be catalyzed by two

TYPES - Palmitoleate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - palmitoleate biosynthesis I
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Palmitoleate is a common unsaturated fatty acid, found in bacteria, fungi |CITS: [8294460]|, plants |CITS: [7548115]| and animals |CITS: [14321753][6030882]|. 
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, two unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate and <i>cis</i>-vaccenate, together comprise about one-half of the total fatty acid content of the organism. Palmitate, palmitoleate and <i>cis</i>-vaccenate make up the bulk of the fatty acids found in <i>E. coli</i> membranes |CITS: [8246839]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS): |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the extension of a cis-&delta;-5-decenoyl-[acp] to a palmitoleoyl-[acp] is believed to be catalyzed primarily by KASI. Inactivation of this enzyme leads to a lack of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [4901354]|. On the other hand, overexpression of KASI leads to the overproduction of <i>cis</i>-vaccenate |CITS: [6337151]|.
/
/It has been shown that the basal ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in <i>E. coli</i> is controlled by the level of two enzymes - |FRAME: FABA-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG10273|) and KASI |CITS: [8246839]|. The former introduces unsaturation (see |FRAME: PWY0-862|), while the other elongates the unsaturated fatty acid to the level of a palmitoleoyl-[acp] (this pathway).
/
/Additional control over this ratio is provided by temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in <i>E. coli</i> with lower growth temperature, a phenomenon found in most organisms that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures. It has been shown that KASII which is responsible for the further elongation of the unsaturated fatty acids to the final level of <i>cis</i>-vaccenate (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|), is more active at low temperatures (relative to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative increase results in the production of <i>cis</i>-vaccenate  rather than palmitoleate. Because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of di-unsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|.

COMMON-NAME - ppGpp biosynthesis

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The nucleotides ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism |CITS: [18039766] [18430135]|.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.
/
/Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new <i>in vitro</i> synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied <i>Escherichia coli</i> many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.
/
/In the <i>E. coli</i> stringent response transcription, translation and DNA replication are affected by (p)ppGpp levels.  Transcription is redirected from genes related to growth to genes involved in survival under starvation and stress conditions.  The regulation of transcription by (p)ppGpp occurs at the transcription initiation stage and affects promoter use.  However, the mechanism remains unclear and direct and indirect models for regulation have been proposed.  It has been shown that ppGpp and a cofactor protein DksA bind to RNA polymerase and modulate its activity at promoters |CITS: [15294157] [15899978]|, although the exact ppGpp binding site(s) responsible for regulation are undefined |CITS: [18272182]|.  Transcription of many &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent genes and genes dependent upon alternative sigma factors is negatively or positively regulated by ppGpp.  In direct models for regulation, ppGpp affects the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction via stabilization, or destabilization of the RNA polymerase-promoter open complex.  Indirect models include changes in the availability of RNA polymerase, and a role for ppGpp in regulating differential binding of sigma factors to core RNA polymerase.  Transcriptional alterations resulting from these mechanisms include repression of tRNA and rRNA synthesis (a key event in limiting the growth rate), induction of stress response factors, and induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport.  Reviewed in |CITS: [16554711] [15686546] [18359660]|.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> the regulation of translation by (p)ppGpp involves its repression of transcription of rRNA, tRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as its interaction with initiation factor IF2 and possibly with elongation factors.  The regulation of DNA replication by (p)ppGpp in <i>E. coli</i> involves inhibition of the initiation step.  The demonstration that the <i>E. coli</i> DnaG primase is inhibited by ppGpp <i>in vitro</i> also suggests inhibition of the elongation step |CITS: [19945481]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18359660]|.
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the products of genes <i>relA</i> and <i>spoT</i> have prominent roles in (p)ppGpp metabolism.  This was shown by the absence of ppGpp in <i>relA</i>/<i>spoT</i> null mutants under stringent conditions |CITS: [2005134]|.  RelA functions as a synthetase and SpoT mainly as a hydrolase, although it also has synthetase activity.  Regulation of these opposing activities is critical for the ability of bacteria to respond to nutritional stress and to avoid a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp..  Homologous variants of the RelA and SpoT genes encoding Rsh proteins (Rel Spo homologs) are found in some bacteria and plants.  The &beta;- and &gamma;-proteobacteria have proteins homologous to RelA and SpoT, while most other bacteria have a bifunctional protein designated Rel.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629]|.
/
/Experiments have shown that regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by RelA in response to amino acid starvation occurs at the level of translation on the ribosome.  Ribosome-associated RelA produces ppGpp in response to the presence of uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site which results in a stalled ribosome.  Regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by SpoT is less well understood, but involves sensing other sources of nutrient stress, such as a limitation in fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [17078815]|.  SpoT also senses phosphate starvation |CITS: [17640895]| and iron limitation |CITS: [15853883]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [16554711]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here for the biosynthesis and metabolism of (p)ppGpp is based upon that shown in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see reference below) except as noted.  Early kinetic studies established the overall pathway of ppGpp metabolism.  The first product of the stringent response to amino acid starvation is pppGpp which is quickly converted to the more stable compound ppGpp.  ppGpp is then hydrolyzed to GDP |CITS: [782536] [321933]|.  A role for a kinase in converting GDP back to GTP to complete a cycle was proposed early (in |CITS: [321933] [365225]|) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the product of gene <i>ndk</i>, was suggested as a likely candidate.  This was supported by mutant studies in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>) although there is no direct evidence for a unique effect of Ndk on (p)ppGpp levels in <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. typhimurium</i> (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).
/
/RelA can catalyze the conversion of both GTP to pppGpp, and GDP to ppGpp with similar <i>S</i><sub>0.5</sub> values derived from the Hill equation.  These values are well below the intracellular pool concentrations of GTP and ATP, but are similar to the intracellular pool concentration of GDP |CITS: [3015258]|.  Therefore pppGpp is probably the main RelA product, although both reactions are shown here (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  In addition to a synthetase (PSI) domain, RelA also contains an inactive hydrolase domain (in |CITS: [18454629]|).  RelA is responsible for ppGpp synthesis during the stringent response to amino acid starvation.
/
/<i>In vivo</i> pppGpp is rapidly converted to ppGpp by Gpp (reviewed in |CITS: [15590778]|).  It is the major route of pppGpp degradation, although minor routes via enzymes with similar activity may also exist (Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).
/
/SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both a hydrolase activity and a weak synthetase activity (designated PSII) |CITS: [2005135] [8730877]|.  The SpoT ppGpp hydrolase activity is inhibited under conditions of physiological stress and has a major role in ppGpp degradation.  The role of the SpoT synthetase (PSII) activity is less clear.  It has been proposed to have a role in maintaining the basal level of ppGpp during exponential growth (in |CITS: [8648647]|).  SpoT also has pppGpp hydrolase activity |CITS: [365225]| and possibly pppGpp synthetase activity.  The putative SpoT pppGpp synthetase activity is based on mutant phenotype.  In &Delta;<i>relA</i>/&Delta;<i>gpp</i> mutants starved for glucose pppGpp accumulates which suggests phosphoryl group transfer to GTP as well as GDP, although the phsophoryl donor is not known (cited as unpublished data in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  This reaction is not shown here.

COMMENT - In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of de novo purine biosynthetic genes 
/are 
/unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the `purR' repressor protein.  In E. 
/coli 
/there are 14 reactions involved in the de novo synthesis of AMP and GMP and these are controlled 
/by 12 known genes. The genes occur mostly as unlinked single units or as small functional operons 
/carrying two or, at the most, three structural genes each.  The purR gene encodes a repressor 
/controlling the synthesis of the enzymes or purine biosynthesis.  Sequences similar to the protected 
/region (PUR box) in purF are present in the regulatory regions of purMN.  The expression of purR 
/was shown to be autoregulated, probably through blocking of transcription elongation by binding 
/of PurR to the two PUR boxes.  So far, six genes/operons have been reported to contain PUR box-like 
/sequences.  The purine biosynthetic pathway is controlled by feedback regulation of activity as 
/well as at the level of transcription.|CITS:[2404765]|
/
/Reactions that convert ADP to ATP are found in multiple pathways, including fueling pathways such 
/as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Purine bases consist of a six-membered and a five-membered nitrogen-containing rings fused together. There are four purine bases, namely |FRAME: ADENINE|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE| and |FRAME: XANTHINE|. Purine nucleotides may be synthesized <i>de novo</i> from simpler precursors, or they may be derived from exogenous purine nucleosides and bases by the salvage pathways.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the salvage pathways collect exogenous, preformed bases and nucleosides for nucleotide synthesis, reutilize bases and nucleosides produced endogenously from nucleotide turnover, and make available the pentose moieties of exogenous nucleosides as sources of carbon. When free bases or nucleosides present in the growth medium are salvaged, the contribution from the <i>de novo</i> pathways to nucleotide synthesis is greatly suppressed.  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: XANTHOSINE Xanthosine| is converted to |FRAME: XANTHINE| by |FRAME: XANTHOSINEPHOSPHORY-CPLX|, one of the two purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs) in <i>E. coli</i>, encoded by the |FRAME: G85| gene |CITS: [7559336][15808857]|. This enzyme does not cleave or synthesize adenosine and deoxyadenosine but catalyzes the phosphorolysis of |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|, |FRAME: INOSINE| and |FRAME: GUANOSINE| with comparable efficiency.
/
/|FRAME: XANTHINE Xanthine| is converted to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| by |FRAME: GPT-CPLX|, a purine salvage enzyme which converts either xanthine or guanine to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| or |FRAME: GMP|, respectively |CITS: [6305942][3886014]|.

TYPES - Adenine-Adenosine-Salvage
COMMON-NAME - adenine and adenosine salvage II
COMMENT - Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>.  In that route |FRAME: AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC|, which is converted to AMP by the action of |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|).  Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways.  The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE|) and free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|).
/
/The pathway described here is found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  In it the purine nucleoside is first hydrolyzed to ribose and an adenine base by nucleoside hydrolases.  The bases are then converted to the mononucleotide form |FRAME: AMP| by |FRAME: ADENPRIBOSYLTRAN-CPLX|, which utilizes |FRAME: PRPP|.

COMMENT - Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| , which is converted to AMP by the action of
/|FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|). Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|).
/
/However, both |FRAME: ADENOSINE| and |FRAME: ADENINE| can be salvaged by certain enzymes, and be converted back to nucleotide form.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: DEOD-CPLX "purine phosphorylase (DeoD)"| (EC 2.4.2.1) cleaves |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-1P|, while a second enzyme, such as |FRAME: ADENPRIBOSYLTRAN-CPLX|, can utilize |FRAME: PRPP| to convert the free base to the mononucleotide |FRAME: AMP|.
/
/Another route from |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: AMP| is acheived in a single step by the enzyme |FRAME: HS08097-MONOMER| (EC 2.7.1.20). The enzyme has been described in bacteria, yeast, plants and animals |CITS: [5092557][8577746][11115893][16511094][17869216][19329636]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.  Their diphosphates
/form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: UDP-GLUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis.  The
/pathway for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is derived from the pathway for
/|FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage
/pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can
/enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY0-181| and |FRAME: PWY0-163|).  These
/essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and
/|FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are
/necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when
/precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate
/and reducing power.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene
/expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic
/precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA|
/gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine
/ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins
/with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from
/glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to
/form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|. 
/The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG|
/biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from
/|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine
/nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|
/(see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY0-662| and |FRAME: PWY0-661|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|,
/|FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the
/DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are
/synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
/that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair. 
/In <i>E. coli</i> this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or
/anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived
/from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|,
/or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.
/
/The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically
/and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257|
/and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a <i>nrdAB</i> deletion mutant. 
/However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes <i>nrdHIEF</i> are overexpressed on a
/plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance
/ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by
/gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812|
/and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied
/|CITS: [16771665]|.
/
/The major pathway for the aerobic, <i>de novo</i> formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate
/precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP|
/to |FRAME: DCTP| and deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUTP| which is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: DUMP|. 
/This pathway supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.  Most of the remainder is presumed to
/be formed from |FRAME: DUDP|, as shown.  In <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: EG11418|, |FRAME: EG10219| mutants, an
/alternate <i>de novo</i> deoxycytidine pathway to |FRAME: DUMP| is used that relies on salvage enzymes
/|CITS: [17827303]|.  Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of
/|FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by
/|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX|.  Two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is
/catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the product
/of gene |FRAME: EG10650| which also catalyzes two preceding reactions.

COMMENT - The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (UTP and CTP) can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> (see
/|FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing pyrimidines (uracil and cytosine) or their nucleosides (uridine and
/cytidine) that might be present in the environment.  Any of these four compounds can serve as a total
/source of pyrimidine for both ribonucleoside triphosphates and subsequently for both deoxyribonucleoside
/triphosphates as well (see |FRAME: PWY0-166|).  Exogenously supplied cytosine is rapidly converted to
/uracil and subsequently converted to UMP which flows through a portion of the <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine
/biosynthesis pathway to UTP and CTP. 
/
/Although enzymes are present in <i>E. coli</i> that are capable of converting cytidine directly to CTP, in
/fact exogenously supplied cytidine does not flow through this pathway.  Instead, a very active cytidine
/deaminase converts it rapidly to uridine, which then flows to UTP and then to CTP.  The existence of the
/direct pathway from cytidine to CTP is an accident of the lack of specificity of uridine kinase. 
/Exogenously supplied cytidine will flow directly to CTP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation.  A
/CMP-specific kinase is present in <i>E. coli</i>.  Its purpose is not to utilize externally supplied cytosine. 
/Instead, it is to recover CMP generated intracellularly by the hydrolytic turnover of RNA.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> makes four polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, cadaverine, and aminopropylcadaverine,
/the syntheses of which are shown here. 
/These positively charged di-cations are essential for normal growth, probably for a number of reasons
/including, neutralizing charges on nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, stimulating certain enzymes and
/balancing intracellular osmotic versus ionic strength.  There is some evidence that cadaverine, the
/decarboxylation product of lysine, and aminopropylcadaverine can substitute for putrescine and spermidine. 
/In the absence of exogenous
/arginine, the principal flow to putrescine and hence spermidine is via ornithine decarboxylase.  In the
/presence of exogenous arginine, however, when ornithine biosynthesis is halted by repression and
/feed-back inhibition, biosynthesis of putrescine occurs in two step from arginine 1) by arginine
/decarboxylase (which is located in the periplasm so that the arginine that flows into polyamines never
/mixes with the intracellular pool of that amino acid) and then 2) by agmatinase which produces urea along
/with putrescine--the only urea-producing reaction in <i>E. coli</i>.

/DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, as well as membrane integrity and resistance to stress, to name a few. 
/Cadaverine and aminopropylcadaverine are alternative polyamines that can at least partially substitute for
/purtrescine and spermidine, the primary polyamines found in <I>E. coli</I>.  Lysine is decarboxylated to
/form cadaverine which is then converted to aminopropylcadaverine by the aminopropyltransferase, SpeE.

COMMENT - This arginine catabolic pathway has been discovered in |FRAME: TAX-83333| by Shaibe et al.
/|CITS:[3897201]|.  The pathway is essentially identical to an anabolic pathway that is used by many
/bacteria for the biosynthesis of putrescine (see |FRAME:PWY-40| |CITS:[4908781]|.  Even though the main
/catabolic arginine pathway of |FRAME: TAX-83333| is the succinyltransferase pathway
/(|FRAME:AST-PWY|), this pathway provides an alternative route, and is used under certain growth
/conditions.  Interestingly, unlike |FRAME: TAX-83333|, wild-type <i>E. coli</i> strains are unable to use
/|FRAME:ARG| as a carbon source, even though they can use it as a nitrogen source |CITS:[3534538]|. 
/
/|FRAME: TAX-83333| has two forms of the enzyme arginine decarboxylase: a constitutive biosynthetic
/form, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10959| gene, and an inducible catabolic form, encoded by the
/|FRAME:EG11501| gene.  When the catabolic form is not expressed, the pathway operates only in an
/anabolic manner, catalyzing the biosynthesis of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, which is used by the bacteria
/either directly or as a precursor for the biosynthesis of other polyamines
/(see |FRAME:POLYAMSYN-PWY|).  However, when the cells are grown in an arginine-rich medium,
/especially if the medium is acidic and conditions are semi-anaerobic, the catabolic arginine decarboxylase
/is expressed, and the pathway operates in a catabolic manner, feeding |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| via
/|FRAME:4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| and |FRAME:SUC| into the |FRAME:TCA| |CITS:[3157043]|.

/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|,

/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and

/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine
/decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase
/(ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|).
/While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis,
/recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860]
/[14738999]|. In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time
/|CITS: [11537482]|.
/In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism
/|CITS:[3157043]|.
/
/There are two flavors of the ADC pathway. In both cases |FRAME:ARG| is first converted to
/|FRAME:AGMATHINE| by a biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase. However, in enterobacteria and
/mycobacteria |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is converted directly to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| by the enzyme
/|FRAME:AGMATIN-CPLX| (this pathway),
/while in higher plants, <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., <i>Aeromonas</i> spp., and
/lactic bacteria, |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is first hydrolyzed by |FRAME:CPLX-31| into |FRAME:CPD-597|

/|FRAME:CPD-597| by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-39| (see pathway |FRAME:PWY-43|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway was studied mostly in enterobacteria, but it was also found in the mycobacteria
/|FRAME: TAX-1771| and |FRAME: TAX-1772| |CITS:[13192096]| and in the Gram positive bacterium
/|FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [9723923]|. While |FRAME: TAX-83333| possesses both an ODC and an ADC
/pathways, in |FRAME: TAX-1423| this is the only |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| biosynthetic pathway.
/Remarkably, even though |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| is only synthesized in |FRAME: TAX-1423| via
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, no intracellular |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| was found in this organism
/|CITS:[9723923]|.
/
/It should be mentioned that in some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-83333|, this pathway can also
/operate in a catabolic manner |CITS:[3897201]|, catalyzing the degradation of |FRAME:ARG|
/through |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| into |FRAME:SUC| (see |FRAME:PWY0-823|).

/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the ODC pathway |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is generated in a single reaction from
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase.
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| can be decarboxylated into |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| for two purposes - either
/anabolically, for the generation of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| as a polyamine on its own, or as a precursor
/of |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, or catabolically, as a carbon and nitrogen source. Catabolic
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| degradation is illustrated in the pathway |FRAME:ORNDEG-PWY|. 
/
/Enteric bacteria possess two forms of ornithine decarboxylase, a biosynthetic
/(or constitutive) form (for example, |FRAME:ORNDECARBOX-BIO-CPLX|), apparently present in all
/strains of <i>E. coli</i>, and a biodegradative (or inducible) form
/(for example, |FRAME:ORNDECARBOXDEG-CPLX|), which is present in only some
/strains of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [3157043] [1939141]|. Other organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-287|
/appear to have only a single |FRAME:CPLX-25|, which is regulated in a complex manner to ensure
/proper expression for both polyamine biosynthesis and catabolism.
/
/Biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase is inhibited by both |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and
/|FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and is activated by |FRAME: GTP| and other nucleotides |CITS: [4370496]|.
/A synthetic compound, |FRAME:DIFLUOROMETHYLORNITHINE|, is a very potent mechanism-based
/(suiside) irreversible inhibitor of most ornithine decarboxylases, which has attracted much attention
/|CITS:[6421528]|.
/Interestingly, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| enzyme is completely immune to this inhibitor |CITS:[6800359]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Enterobactin is a catecholate siderophore that enables E. coli to scavenge 
/iron from the environment. It is a cyclic compound of three units of 
/2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine joined in a cyclic structure by lactone linkages.
/Only the &delta;-cis isomer of the ferric chelate is biologically active. 
/Enterobactin is synthesized under iron-deficient conditions and excreted into
/the environment where it binds Fe(III) with high affinity and specificity. The
/ferrisiderophore complexes are taken up into the cell by specific transport
/components. Enterobactin synthesis is divided into two parts:  1) the conversion
/of chorismate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate and 2) the synthesis of enterobactin
/from 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate and serine. The former part of the pathway is better
/understood than the latter. The second part of the pathway may be catalyzed by
/a multi-enzyme complex, however recent studies have failed to prove its 
/existence.  |CITS: [ColiSalII] [9025288]|

COMMON-NAME - glycerol degradation I
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Glycerol uptake in bacteria is mediated by the glycerol diffusion facilitator, an integral membrane protein 
/catalyzing the rapid equilibration of concentration gradients of glycerol across the cytoplasmic 
/membrane |CITS: [8436953]|. 
/Intracellular glycerol is converted to glycerol-3-Phosphate (Glycerol-3-P) by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses 
/ATP as phosphoryl donor. Glycerol-3-P is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator and thus remains 
/in the cell, where it is further metabolized. 
/As a result, the driving force for the uptake of glycerol is generated by the 
/phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase |CITS: [9162046]|. 
/
/
/While Glycerol-3-P can not leave the cytoplasm, it can be imported into 
/the cell by the GlpT transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, that couples the import of glycerol-3-P 
/into the cytoplasm to the export of inorganic phosphates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm 
/|CITS: [3522583][12893936]|. 
/
/
/In addition, <i>E. coli</i> K12 possesses two systems the salvage of
/glycerophosphoryl diesters, the Glp system and the Ugp system. 
/
/In the Glp system, the <i>glpQ</i> gene encodes a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester
/phosphodiesterase (periplasmic GDP) which hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to
/an alcohol plus Glycerol-3-P . The Glycerol-3-P is then transported into the cell by the GlpT transporter.
/Periplasmic GDP is specific for the glycerophospho- moiety of the substrate, while the
/alcohol can be any one of several alcohols. This provides the cell
/with the capability of channeling a wide variety of
/glycerophosphodiesters into the <i>glpQT</i>-encoded dissimilatory system.
/
/
/In the Ugp system the diesters are hydrolyzed during transport at the
/cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to Glycerol-3-P plus alcohol by a cytoplasmic GDP, an enzyme
/encoded by the <i>ugpQ</i> gene. 
/The Ugp system is induced when the cells are starved for inorganic phospate, which is  generates phosphate by 
/the system |CITS: [1851953]|. 
/
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> glycerol-3-P can be further metabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by either of two 
/membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage 
/of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. 
/Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic glycerol-3-P 
/dehydrogenase (encoded by the <i>glpD</i> gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the 
/electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|.  
/Under anaerobic conditions, a different glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase is preferentially expressed. This 
/tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the <i>glpACB</i> opron, channels the electrons from 
/glycerol-3-P to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL "Methylglyoxal"| is produced in small amounts during glycolysis(via |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|), fatty acid metabolism (via |FRAME:ACETONE|) and protein metabolism (via |FRAME:AMINO-ACETONE|). |FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL "Methylglyoxal"| is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see |CITS: [10597025]| for a review). There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds. These enzymes include glyoxalaseenzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxaldehydrogenases.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The most common pathway for methylglyoxal detoxification is the glyoxalase system, which is composed of two enzymes that together convert |FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL| to |FRAME: D-LACTATE| in the presence of |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| (see |FRAME:PWY-5386|). However, in <i>E. coli</i>, a single enzyme, |FRAME: GLYOXIII-CPLX|, catalyzes this conversion in a single step without involvement of glutathione |CITS: [7848303]|. Activity of |FRAME:GLYOXIII-CPLX| increases at the transition to stationary phase and expression is dependent on RpoS, suggesting that this pathway may be important during stationary phase |CITS: [15448747]|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of 4-aminobutyrate degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - 4-aminobutyrate (or &gamma;-aminobutyrate, GABA) is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay.  In many bacteria, GABA can be synthesized as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation|).  <i>E. coli</i> K-12 can utilize GABA as the sole source of nitrogen with a slow generation time of approximately 400 minutes |CITS: [12446648]|.  It was initially reported that <i>E. coli</i> K-12 can not utilize GABA as the sole source of either nitrogen or carbon; mutants that have gained both abilities can be isolated |CITS: [4550821]| and may affect regulation. 
/
/The first reaction of this pathway, the transfer of the amino group from GABA to 2-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate and succinate semialdehyde, can be catalyzed by two independently expressed  4-aminobutyrate aminotransferases.  Succinate semialdehyde is a toxic intermediate; two dehydrogenases with differing cosubstrate requirements catalyze its detoxification by dehydrogenation to succinate.
/
/Mutants in the <i>gab</i> operon are still able to grow on putrescine due to the presence of the alternative putrescine degradation pathway (|FRAME: PWY0-1221|) which includes the alternative |FRAME: G6646-MONOMER|.
/
/While all tested nitrogen sources induce this pathway, it does not contribute to the catabolism of any other nitrogen source but GABA |CITS: [12446648]|.  The authors speculate that the main purpose of this pathway is to keep putrescine concentrations in check during nitrogen-limited growth |CITS: [12446648]|.  Regulation of expression of the <i>gab</i> enzymes in this pathway is complex and may involve post-transcriptional control mechanisms |CITS: [14731280]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well. 
/
/The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|.  Different variants of both enzymes are known.  The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862|).  Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirements, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.
/
/While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capability to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation "putrescine degradation"|). 
/
/The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> can utilize putrescine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen.  The enzymes of the |FRAME: PWY0-1221| pathway are inducible by extracellular putrescine, leading to the production of GABA.  Both enzymes of this pathway are inducible by putrescine in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [20639325]|.
/
/This variant of the pathway includes a |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase.  This combination of enzymes has been documented in bacteria and animals and in some plants.
/
/Regarding the hydrogenase, NAD-specific variants have been studied from many bacteria, plant and animals.

COMMON-NAME - allantoin degradation to glyoxylate III
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME:ALLANTOIN "Allantoin"| is a common product of purine degradation.  Allantoin is rich in nitrogen, and many organisms are able to degrade and recycle it.  Some bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1458|, |FRAME: TAX-80866| and |FRAME: TAX-264198|, do so under aerobic conditions, while others such as |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: ORG-5985| and |FRAME: TAX-587| do so only anaerobically.
/
/Allantoin degradation is not limited to bacteria.  Ureide-transporting plants convert fixed nitrogen in their roots to |FRAME:ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|, which are then transported to upper parts of the plant, where they are degraded to release the nitrogen.  In addition, some fungi and animals also degrade allantoin.
/
/The first step of the pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-64|, comprises the hydrolysis of the internal amide bond of |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN|, forming |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| |CITS: [786256]|.  This enzyme turned out to be common to all organisms that can degrade allantoin, and is the first step in all allantoin degradation pathways.
/
/|FRAME: ALLANTOATE "Allantoate"| is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-2298| via one of two routes.  In the first route, the nitrogen is liberated in a single step in the form of |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: ALLANTOICASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.4"|), while in the other route it is liberated in the form of |FRAME: AMMONIA| in two steps, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD0-2298| (starting with |FRAME: ALLANTOATE-DEIMINASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.9"|).
/
/The next step in the pathway is the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX|.  Similarly, this conversion can proceed with the liberation of either |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-LYASE-RXN "EC 4.3.2.3"|) or |FRAME: AMMONIA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-HYDROLASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.19"|).
/
/Several combinations of these routes have been documented.  Some organisms possess pathways that produce solely |FRAME: UREA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5694|), some produce only |FRAME: AMMONIA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5692|), and some produce both (see |FRAME: PWY-5705|).  In addition, some anaerobic organisms can degrade allantoin to |FRAME: CPD-389| instead of |FRAME: GLYOX| (see |FRAME: PWY0-41|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this hybrid pathway |FRAME: CPLX-7524| and |FRAME: G6284-MONOMER| catalyze the first two deamination steps, producing |FRAME: CPD-1091| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|, while |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| gives rise to |FRAME:GLYOX| and |FRAME: UREA|.  Glyoxylate could then enter general metabolism, where it would be converted by the successive action of three enzymes to 3-phosphoglycerate, feeding into |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS| (see |FRAME: GLYCOLATEMET-PWY|).  However, this route would imply that allantoin <b>can</b> serve as a sole source of carbon for <i>E. coli</i>, which it can not.  It has been speculated that this pathway is not utilized in <i>E. coli</i> due to the low expression of |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| |CITS: [19935661]|.  Additionally, |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| is poorly characterized.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Several metabolic pathways for the degradation of putrescine are known. The first <i>E. coli</i> K-12 putrescine degradation pathway was found in in 1985 |CITS:[3897201]| (see |FRAME:PUTDEG-PWY |).  That pathway is dedicated to the degradation of intracellular putrescine. A second pathway was found in <i>E. coli</i> K-12 twenty years later.  This pathway seems to be dedicated to the degradation of extracellular putrescine |CITS: [15590624]|.
/
/The pathway was discovered following the discovery of a cluster of seven unassigned genes on the <i>E. coli</i> K-12 chromosome.  In addition to a putrescine transporter, encoded by the <i>puuP</i> gene, the cluster contains four genes that encode the enzymes involved in this pathway, and two additional genes (<i>puuE</i> and <i>puuR</i>) that encode an enzyme involved in the catabolism of GABA (see |FRAME: 4AMINOBUTMETAB-PWY|) and a regulator |CITS: [15590624]|.
/
/In this pathway, putrescine is &gamma;-glutamylated at the expense of an ATP molecule. The resulting  &gamma;-glutamyl-putrescine is oxidized to &gamma;-glutamyl-&gamma;-aminobutyraldehyde, which is then dehydrogenated into 4-(glutamylamino) butanoate. In the last step, the &gamma;-glutamyl group is removed by hydrolysis, generating 4-aminobutyrate. 
/
/The key difference between this pathway and |FRAME:PUTDEG-PWY| is the &gamma;-glutamylation of putrescine. In the other pathway, putrescine is degraded directly to 4-amino-butanal |CITS: [15590624]|.

COMMENT - Through this single pathway either L- or D-alanine can be degraded to pyruvate which
/enters central metabolism, and thereby, can serve as a growth-supporting, total source of carbon and energy.
/This pathway is unique among those through which L-amino acids are degraded in that the L form must first be 
/converted to the D form. This first step of the pathway, which can be catalyzed by either of two racemases, also 
/serves an essential role in biosynthesis because its product, D-alanine is an essential component of cell wall 
/peptidoglycan (murein). The role of the <i>alr</i> racemase is predominately biosynthetic: it is produced constitutively in 
/small amounts. The role of the <i>dadX</i> racemase is degradative: it is induced to high levels by alanine and 
/is subject to catabolite repression.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Although some prokaryotes possess several pathways that degrade arginine, this one (called the AST
/pathway for its crucial enzyme, arginine succinyl transferase) is the only arginine-degrading pathway
/found in <i>E. coli</i>.  This pathway, which yields 2 molecules of ammonia and 2 of glutamate, can
/satisfy <i>E. coli</i>'s total nitrogen requirement, but not its total carbon requirement.  It does, however,
/permit other organisms, for example <i>Klebsiella aerogenes</i>, to utilize arginine as a total source of
/carbon.  With the exception of the third enzyme in the pathway, succinylornithine transaminase (encoded
/by <i>astC</i>), enzymes of this pathway from <i>E. coli</i> have not been characterized beyond
/assaying crude extracts.  Succinylornithine transaminase gained special attention and was originally
/designated as <i>argM</i> because is can substitute for acetylornithine transaminase (encoded by
/<i>argD</i>) in the biosynthesis of arginine.  The substrates of the two enzymes differ only in ornithine's
/being acetylated in the biosynthetic pathway and succinylated in the degradative pathway.

COMMENT - <b>About this pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, L-cysteine degradation is carried out by L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity (CD) |CITS: [9572924]|. CD is known to catalyze the degradation of L-cysteine to pyruvate, ammonia, and sulfide |CITS: [14907623][13271322][12883870][16000837]|. In <i>E. coli</i>, cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), primarily catalyzes the conversion of cystathionine to homocysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia |CITS: [7049234]| while tryptophanase (TnaA) mainly degrades L-tryptophan to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia |CITS: [14171448]|. Both of them have been shown to exhibit CD activity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [704923][1428472][12883870]|.  
/
/It was recently found that in addition to tryptophanase (TnaA) and cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), three additional proteins exhibit the PLP-dependent-L-cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) activity. These are OAS sulfhydrylase A (CysK), OAS sulfhydrylase B (CysM), and the MalY protein. CysK primarily catalyzes the synthesis of L-cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide along the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway. CysM is considered to be an isomer of CysK with unidentified function. MalY protein has activity of the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage (&beta; C-S lyase) of cystathionine. The gene disruption for each protein significantly decreases the CD activity and is effective for overproduction of L-cysteine. The decrease in CD activity for all these genes disruption is reversed in the presence of L-cysteine except for the <i>tnaA</i> gene disruption. This result suggests that TnaA is a key enzyme in L-cysteine degradation in <i>E. coli</i>. Disruption of all the <i>tnaA</i>, <i>metC</i>, <i>cysK</i>, <i>cysM</i> and <i>malY</i> genes together also show much higher CD activity in the presence of L-cysteine than in its absence |CITS: [16000837][16820466]|. Unidentified proteins with CD activity are found, which may be induced by L-cysteine.
/
/Amino acids, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and alanine inhibit the CD activity in <i>E. coli</i>. Alanine, which is most similar to cysteine in configuration, shows the greatest amount of inhibition. Tris- (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, an effective carbonyl agent also caused significant inhibition to the CD activity |CITS: [13271322]|.

COMMENT - Under conditions of anaerobiosis and phosphate starvation (believed to reflect conditions in the gut),
/<I>E. coli</I> converts glucose to weak organic acids which, though they are excreted, can reenter
/the cell and cause bactericidal acid stress even at only moderately acidic pH.  Acid resistance
/system 4 (AR4) is the lysine-dependent acid resistance system which allows for the survival of
/<I>E. coli</I> under these conditions when lysine is available.  AR4 couples the transport activity
/of a lysine:cadaverine antiporter, CadB, with lysine decarboxylase, CadA.  CadB functions by
/exchanging external lysine for internal cadaverine.  Lysine is imported into the cell through CadB. 
/Within the cell lysine is decarboxylated by CadA to cadaverine, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> and
/replacing it with a proton.  Cadaverine is then exported through CadB.  This effectively consumes
/protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  The glutamate-dependent acid resistance system
/(AR2) is also able to provide acid resistance to <I>E. coli</I> growing under conditions of anaerobiosis
/and phosphate starvation, but to a slightly lesser degree than AR4 possibly due to the different pH
/optimums of their respective decarboxylase enzymes. |CITS:[17209032]| 
/AR2 is more efficient than AR3 or AR4 as a mediator of acid resistance at low pH. |CITS:[15494746]|

/a total source of carbon and energy for <i>E. coli</i>, because glutamate transport supplies exogenous
/glutamate at an inadequate rate. 
/
/Sometimes the proline degradation pathway is shown in three steps, with glutamate-5-semialdehyde as an
/intermediate between pyrroline-5-carboxylate and glutamate.  The conversion of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to

/stimulate the reaction. 
/
/In addition to its being a building block of proteins, proline acts as an osmotic protectant.  Consistent with
/this latter role, high osmolarity inhibits proline degradation.

COMMENT - The L-serine degradation pathway consists of a single step conversion
/of L-serine to pyruvate and ammonia.
/
/Serine is not a typical carbon source for the cell. Perhaps unsurprisingly,
/two of the three serine deaminases involved in this pathway are known
/to be expressed only in the absence of glucose.
/
/Although only one of the three primary serine deaminases has been shown to be
/expressed solely under anaerobic conditions, all three enzymes
/rely on catalytically critical iron-sulfur clusters that are oxygen sensitive,
/suggesting that this pathway can only work in the absence of oxygen. This
/concept is bolstered by the fact that the bifunctional threonine/serine deaminase,
/TdcB, is also expressed only in the absence of oxygen.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THR| is an indispensable amino acid. It is degraded by a complex network of pathways and regulatory signals |CITS: [9871012]|. 
/
/Two of the major routes for the degradation of L-threonine are known to occur both in mammals and in microorganisms. In the first route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (EC 4.3.1.19) to |FRAME: AMMONIA| and |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|, which is rapidly and irreversibly converted to |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| and |FRAME: FORMATE| (see |FRAME:PWY-5437|). A biosynthetic version of this enzyme has also been reported in certain anaerobic bacteria (see |FRAME:ILEUSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [13405870]|.
/
/In the second route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| (EC 1.1.1.103) to form |FRAME:AMINO-OXOBUT|, which is mainly cleaved by |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|, forming glycine and acetyl-CoA (see |FRAME:THREONINE-DEG2-PWY|). In the absence of the later activity |FRAME:AMINO-OXOBUT| is spontaneously converted to |FRAME:AMINO-ACETONE|, which is further metabolized into |FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL| (see |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).
/
/A third route has been demonstrated in several bacteria and fungi. This route is based on the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-7266| (EC 4.1.2.5), which cleaves threonine directly into |FRAME:GLY| and |FRAME:ACETALD| (see |FRAME:PWY-5436|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i> E. coli</i>, the first reaction in the pathway by which threonine is used as a nitrogen source, aerobically and anaerobically, is catalyzed by the enzyme threonine dehydrogenase (TDH). The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate formed as a result of the TDH-catalyzed reaction is converted to glycine by the enzyme 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase. Threonine does not serve as the sole carbon and energy source for <i>E. coli</i> K-12.  It is not even a good nitrogen source, but, to the extent that it serves as nitrogen source, it does so via conversion to glycine. Glycine serves as the actual nitrogen donor by its conversion to serine and deamination of serine. TDH is formed in cells grown in aerated synthetic medium with glucose; its activity is increased in cells grown with L-leucine.  The enzyme formed under anaerobic conditions and known as threonine deaminase (biodegradative) is less widespread than TDH and may be involved in energy metabolism or in nitrogen transfer than in threonine degradation per se |CITS: [334738]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Tryptophanase (tryptophan indole-lyase; EC 4.1.99.1) is a catabolic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible
/conversion of tryptophan to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia, in an &alpha;,&beta;-elimination reaction.  It is
/one of most studied pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-requiring multifunctional enzymes, and at high substrate
/concentrations it can perform additional &alpha;,&beta;-elimination, as well as &beta;-replacement
/reactions.  Tryptophanase can also catalyze the synthesis of tryptophan |CITS: [4556453]|, either from
/indole, ammonia and pyruvate, or from indole and serine or cysteine |CITS: [14171448]|.
/
/A commercial use of tryptophanase is found in the manufacturing of the indigo dye.  A bacterial system has
/been introduced in which <i>E. coli</i> has been engineered to express tryptophanase and naphtalene
/(di)oxygenase, breaking down tryptophan to indole, and converting indole to indoxyl, which subsequently
/oxidizes spontaneously to generate indigo |CITS: [6353574][7763440]|.

/3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate.  Degradation of these two compounds
/ultimately yields succinate, acetaldehyde and pyruvate.  Acetaldehyde is

COMMENT - Phenylacetate is a common source of carbon and energy for a variety of microorganisms, including <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>E. coli</i>.  Of the <i>E. coli</i> K-12 strains, MG1655, W3110, C600 and others are able to utilize phenylacetate, while <i>E. coli</i> C, the K-12 strains HB101, DH1, JM109 and others can not |CITS: [9748275]|. 
/
/The functions of the pathway enzymes and its intermediates have been elucidated by |CITS: [20660314]|.  Phenylacetate is first converted to phenylacetyl-CoA by phenylacetate-CoA ligase.  The multicomponent monooxygenase composed of the PaaABCE subunits produces the highly unstable |FRAME: CPD0-2362|.  An isomerase cleaves the ring C-C bond, producing the highly unusual unsaturated, oxygen-containing seven-member heterocyclic enol ether, |FRAME: CPD0-2363|.  In a two-step reaction, the C-O heterocyclic ring is then cleaved by PaaZ, and the open-chain aldehyde intermediate is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-2364|.  The &beta;-ketothiolase PaaJ cleaves this C<sub>8</sub> compound into the C<sub>6</sub> compound |FRAME: CPD0-2365| and acetyl-CoA.  The enoyl-CoA hydratase PaaF converts this compound to |FRAME: 3-HYDROXYADIPYL-COA|.  PaaH is an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependend dehydrogenase that produces |FRAME: 3-KETO-ADIPYL-COA|, which is converted to one molecule each of acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA by PaaJ.

COMMON-NAME - glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/It is well known that <i>Escherichia coli</i> can use glucose as a sole source of carbon and energy.  The D isomer of glucose is widely found in nature and the &beta;-D-glucose anomer is predominant in aqueous solution |CITS: [FRANKS87]|.  Exogenous &beta;-D-glucose enters the cell through outer membrane porins and is then actively transported into the cell via the inner membrane phosphotransferase system (PTS) which transforms it into &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate as it crosses the cell membrane.  &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate is also produced biosynthetically during gluconeogenesis.  &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate is one of the basic precursor metabolites for biosynthetic pathways.  It is also a substrate for the central degradative pathways glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> can also grow on exogenously supplied glucose-1-phosphate (minimal medium containing glucose 1-phosphate) as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]|.  Endogenous &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is an intermediate in the metabolism of glycogen and galactose.  It is a building block for the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, which is used in some biosynthetic pathways.   Reviewed by Mayer, C. and W. Boos in |CITS: [ecosal]| (see below).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The dashed line connecting D-glucose with &beta;-D-glucose is meant to show that the pathway is possible, but incompletely defined.  The anomeric form (&alpha; or &beta;) of the D-glucose product of EC 3.1.3.10 is not specified by the EC and it was not found in the literature for the indicated phosphatases.  However, if &alpha;-D-glucose is produced, it may either spontaneously convert to &beta;-D-glucose, or <i>E. coli</i> aldose-1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) could convert it to &beta;-D-glucose |CITS: [7966338]| and in |CITS: [4711601]|.
/
/Substrates &beta;-D-glucose and &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate may be derived from exogenous sources, or endogenously produced, as indicated by the input pathway links.  In general, the ability to utilize sugars and their modes of utilization are strain-dependent in <i>Escherichia coli</i>.
/
/Exogenous &beta;-D-glucose uptake via the PTS curbs the utilization of other exogenous sugars, which is known as the glucose effect.  This effect is lost if &beta;-D-glucose becomes limiting.  Under these conditions &beta;-D-glucose can also enter the cell without phosphorylation, via outer membrane porins and the Mgl ABC transporter (not shown).
/
/Endogenous &beta;-D-glucose can be produced by pathways for the degradation of glucose-containing disaccharides such as maltose (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|) trehalose, lactose and melibiose, as shown in the pathway links.  In contrast to exogenous &beta;-D-glucose  which is phosphorylated by the PTS, endogenous &beta;-D-glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase before entering central metabolism, as shown in the pathway links (in |CITS: [9023215]|).  More recently, a role for glucokinase and glucose in a complex regulatory mechanism for maltose utilization involving Glk, MalT, Mlc and PtsG has been proposed |CITS: [19028900]|.
/
/It is possible that high levels of &beta;-D-glucose could accumulate inside the cell under certain conditions.  It has been shown that the maltose acetyltransferase product of gene <i>maa</i> efficiently acetylates both maltose and &beta;-D-glucose (not shown).  Evidence suggests that acetylation could be a detoxification mechanism in which acetylated &beta;-D-glucose diffuses from the cell |CITS: [7012137] [1856235]|. 
/
/There is evidence that &beta;-D-glucose can be oxidized to glucono-&delta;-lactone (glucono-1,5-lactone) by inner membrane glucose dehydrogenase.  However, the fate of the glucono-&delta;-lactone remains unclear.  It has been reported that membrane vesicles from glucose-grown <i>E. coli</i> oxidized glucose to gluconate in the presence of pyrrolo-quinoline quinone, a cofactor for glucose dehydrogenase |CITS: [3926746]|.  A gluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.17) has been partially characterized in <i>E. coli</i>, but its D-gluconate product was not specifically identified |CITS: [4625870]| and no gene encoding this enzyme has been identified.  D-gluconate can be degraded by a glucose utilization pathway that was described early |CITS: [14882337]|, as shown in the pathway link.  In addition, more recent work suggested possible excretion of D-gluconate although this compound was not specifically identified |CITS: [20215780]|.
/
/&alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is reversibly converted by phosphoglucomutase to &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate.  &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is used in glycogen biosynthesis (see |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|) and is produced during glycogen degradation (see |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|).  &alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate may spontaneously convert to &beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate in the physiological pH range |CITS: [14275652]|.  In addition, a glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase had been identified in <i>E. coli</i> ATCC 9637 that could catalyze this production of &beta;-D-glucose 6-phosphate.
/
/Several phosphatases may catalyze the production of D-glucose (anomeric form unspecified) from &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate.  The product of gene <i>agp</i> is a periplasmic enzyme that scavenges glucose and allows <i>E. coli</i> to grow with glucose-1-phosphate as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]| and in |CITS: [12782623]|.

COMMON-NAME - L-lyxose degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - L-lyxose is an uncommon sugar in nature, and wild-type <I>E. coli</I> can not utilize it as a sole source of carbon
/and energy.  However, mutations can arise that allow <I>E. coli</I> to metabolize L-lyxose through the use of
/enzymes of the rhamnose, arabinose and 2,3-diketo-L-gulonate systems. 
/
/L-lyxose enters the cell through the <I>rhaT</I>-encoded rhamnose transporter.  It is then isomerized to
/L-xylulose by |FRAME: RHAMNISOM-MONOMER|. 
/
/Two types of mutations then allow further utilization of L-xylulose.  Not shown here, a mutated from of
/|FRAME: RHAMNULOKIN-MONOMER| can phosphorylate L-xylulose, yielding L-xylulose-1-phosphate.  Further
/metabolism to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glycolate occurs through the
/|FRAME: RHAMNULPALDOL-CPLX| and |FRAME: ALD-CPLX| enzymes.  These products can enter glycolate
/degradation and glycolysis |CITS:[1650346]|.  
/
/As shown here, L-xylulose can be phosphorylated by |FRAME: LYXK-CPLX| in a mutant in which YiaJ, the repressor
/for the <I>yiaKLMNO-lyxK-sgbHUE</I> operon, has been disrupted |CITS: [7961955]|.  L-xylulose-5-phosphate is
/then further metabolized by |FRAME: EG12286-MONOMER| (so far only a predicted function) and either of two
/L-ribulose 5-phosphate 4-epimerases (SgbE or AraD) to D-xylulose-5-phosphate, which then enters the

COMMENT - 2-O-&alpha;-Mannosyl-D-glycerate (MG) is an osmolyte utilized by hyperthermophilic archaea and
/bacteria (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME:PWY-5656|). 
/<I>E. coli</I> is able to utilize MG as a carbon source but not as protection against osmotic stress. 
/MG utilization is controlled by the divergently transcribed <I>mngR</I> gene and <I>mngAB</I> operon. 
/MngR acts as a repressor of the expression both <I>mngR</I> and <I>mngAB</I>. 
/MngA is the EII of a PEP-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system responsible for the

COMMENT - D-ribose, which can serve as a total source of carbon and energy for <i>E. coli</i>, enters the cell via a
/high-affinity ABC transport system and hence in unphosphorylated form.  The crystal structure of the periplasmic
/ribose binding protein of the |FRAME: ABC-28-CPLX| showed it to bind (and thus presumably to facilitate transport
/of) |FRAME: CPD0-1110| |CITS: [1583688]|.  |FRAME: CPLX0-7646| accelerates the conversion between the
/pyranose and furanose forms of &beta;-D-ribose.  Interconversion of the &alpha;- and &beta;-anomers of
/D-ribofuranose is fast and spontaneous |CITS: [15060078]|.  |FRAME: CPLX0-7647| then converts it to
/|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, and hence it flows through the
/pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and
/metabolic energy.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i> the disaccharide lactose is degraded by hydrolysis of the &beta;-1,4 glycosidic bond by 
/&beta;-galactosidase, producing &beta;-D-glucose and &beta;-D-galactose.  The enzyme can also catalyze 
/conversion of lactose to allolactose (&beta;-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-6)-D-glucopyranose) by transglycosylation, 
/and can hydrolyze allolactose (in |CITS: [6767683]|).  Allolactose is the physiological inducer of this pathway.  
/
/Further metabolism of glucose and galactose inside the cell is thought to proceed by their initial transport out of the 
/cell, followed by reentry.  It has been shown that when lactose is added to a growing culture of <i>E. coli</i>, 
/galactose, glucose and allolactose reach high levels inside the cells and are rapidly effluxed into the medium 
/|CITS: [6767683]|.  It has also been shown that an <i>E. coli </i> mutant defective in the uptake of glucose and 
/galactose grew poorly with lactose as a sole carbon source.  Additional transport rate and radiotracer studies 
/supported the efflux mechanism |CITS: [6426769]|.  No <i>E. coli</i> genes specifically involved in sugar efflux during 
/lactose metabolism have been conclusively identified.  However, SetA and SetB, members of the SET 
/(sugar efflux transporter) family may have a role |CITS: [10438463] [10209755]|.
/
/It has been suggested that as glucose reenters the cell it could be phosphorylated to glucose-1-phosphate by the 
/phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (in |CITS: [6767683]|).  Glucose-1-phosphate could then be 
/converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase and enter glycolysis.  Galactose could reenter the cell 
/by facilitated diffusion (in |CITS: [6767683]|), or active transport systems <i>gal</i>P, or <i>mgl</i> 
/(Lin in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|).  Galactose can also be converted to glucose-1-phosphate 
/(Fraenkel in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|).  (See EcoCyc pathways:  glucose and glucose-1-phosphate degradation; 
/galactose degradation I; and superpathway of glycolysis and Entner-Doudoroff).  
/
/The <i>E. coli lac</i>Z gene coding for &beta;-galactosidase is the first of three structural genes of the historically 
/significant <i>lac</i> operon.  The study of this operon provided the primary basis for the original operon concept 
/|CITS: [13718526]|.  Lactose and other galactosides are transported into the cell by lactose permease, the product of 
/the second structural gene of the operon |CITS: [12893935]|.  The third structural gene codes for galactoside 
/acetyltransferase (thiogalactoside transacetylase).  The proposed function of this enzyme is acetylation of potentially 
/toxic pyranosides that are exported from the cell, thereby preventing their reentry |CITS: [11937062]|.  A review of 
/biochemical studies of the three <i>lac</i> enzymes by Zabin and Fowler can be found in |CITS: [Operon78]|.

TYPES - Trehalose-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - trehalose degradation II (trehalase)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3339349358:keseler
COMMENT - While <i>E. coli</i> only synthesizes trehalose under conditions of high osmolarity, it can degrade the sugar under conditions of both low and high osmolarity and can utilize it as the sole carbon source.  Different pathways are employed under different osmolarity conditions.
/
/Under high osmotic conditions the bacterium synthesizes large amounts of trehalose, which is used as an osmoprotectant |CITS: [3131312]|.  Trehalose molecules that leak from the cytoplasm into the periplasm can be
/recycled by the action of the TreA, a periplasmic trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1466|).
/
/A second trehalase, TreF, is located in the cytoplasm and is active during the transition period between high and low osmolarity.  As the cells are shifting their metabolism to adjust to low osmolarity, TreF removes the internal pool of trehalose.  The relatively low enzymatic activity of TreF is low enough not to compromise the biosynthesis of trehalose during high osmolarity, yet is sufficient to degrade the accumulated trehalose after the return to normal conditions, when no more biosynthesis occurs |CITS: [8892826]|.

TYPES - Trehalose-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - trehalose degradation VI (periplasmic)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3478461289:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/There are several alternative pathways for the degradation of trehalose.  Depending on the organism and the particular environmental conditions, trehalose may be broken down outside of the cytoplasm, enter the cell either through a permease, in which case it remains unmodified, or it may be transported by a phosphotransferase system (PTS), resulting in the phosphorylated trehalose-6-phosphate form.  Degradation can proceed by different mechanisms:  Unmodified trehalose may be degraded by a hydrolyzing trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182| and |FRAME: PWY0-1466|), or it may be split by the action of a trehalose phosphorylase (see |FRAME: PWY-2722| and |FRAME: PWY-2723|).  Likewise, trehalose-6-phosphate may be either hydrolyzed by trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (see |FRAME: TREDEGLOW-PWY|) or it could be attacked by a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (see |FRAME: PWY-2721|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Trehalase enzymes hydrolyze a molecule of |FRAME: TREHALOSE| into two molecules of |FRAME:GLC|. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> can grow with trehalose as the sole carbon source, and employs different pathways for its degradation under different osmolarity conditions.  Under conditions of high osmolarity, the PTS pathway for uptake of trehalose (|FRAME: TREDEGLOW-PWY|) is blocked.  The |FRAME: TREHALAPERI-MONOMER| (TreA) provides the cell the ability to utilize trehalose under those conditions |CITS: [2671658]|.  External trehalose is hydrolyzed by TreA into two molecules of glucose |CITS: [2820965]|, which are then transported into the cytoplasm through the glucose PTS |CITS: [1825082]|.  TreA also has a second function: under high osmotic conditions, the bacterium synthesizes large amounts of trehalose to be used as an osmoprotectant.  TreA recycles trehalose molecules that leak from the cytoplasm into the periplasm |CITS: [3131312]|.

CITATIONS - 6370169:EV-EXP-IDA:3478373861:keseler
COMMENT - While <i>E. coli</i> only synthesizes trehalose under conditions of high osmolarity, it can degrade the sugar under conditions of both low and high osmolarity and can utilize it as the sole carbon source.  Different pathways are employed under different osmolarity conditions.
/
/The cell only synthesizes trehalose under high-osmolarity conditions.  Therefore, the only source of trehalose under low-osmolarity conditions is external.  Utilization of trehalose is induced by the presence of trehalose in the medium.  Trehalose is imported into the cell by the |FRAME: CPLX-168|, which is composed of the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> of the glucose PTS and a trehalose-specific |FRAME: TREB-MONOMER "EII<sup>Tre</sup>"|.  Trehalose is phosphorylated during transport and enters the cytoplasm as  trehalose-6-phosphate.
/
/The resulting trehalose-6-phosphate is then hydrolyzed by |FRAME: TRE6PHYDRO-MONOMER|, yielding glucose and glucose-6-phosphate.  The free glucose is phosphorylated further by glucokinase into a second molecule of glucose-6-phosphate, and both glucose-6-phosphate moieties enter glycolysis |CITS: [6370169][7608078][8083158]|.

COMMENT - Acetate plays multiple roles in the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>.  In the absence of other substrates
/acetate can serve as a total source of carbon and energy (see |FRAME: PWY0-1313|).
/During sugar fermentation (under anaerobic conditions), acetate is produced and excreted into the
/medium (by a mechanism that is not yet clearly established) as a major fermentation product.
/Acetate is also produced during aerobic growth in the presence of glucose. Again, acetate is excreted
/in significant amounts into the medium, usually to be utilized later, when glucose is depleted.
/All these transformations of acetate flow through one or the other of the two parallel pathways
/shown here. 
/
/The <i>ack-pta</i> pathway, which is constitutively expressed, participates the aerobic utilization of
/acetate and in its excretion both aerobically and anaerobically. 
/
/In contrast the <i>acs</i> pathway is an inducible pathway that plays a major role in the aerobic
/utilization of acetate. Because it is a high-affinity system, the <i>acs</i> pathway is the major scavenger
/of acetate when extracellular concentrations of it are low.  It also enables <i>E. coli</i> to utilize
/propionate. Mutant strains blocked in the <i>acs</i> pathway grow poorly on acetate.
/
/Mutants blocked in both pathways are unable to grow on acetate.  
/<i>E. coli</i> is one of very few organisms that possess both pathways.

COMMENT - Under aerobic conditions, <i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize D-malate as the sole source of carbon for growth.  D-malate is transported into the cell by the proton motive force-dependend dicarboxylate transporter |FRAME: DCTA-MONOMER "DctA"|.  A D-malate-specific enzyme, |FRAME: G6986-MONOMER|, decarboxylates D-malate to pyruvate while reducing NAD<sup>+</sup>.  Pyruvate then enters central metabolism via |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|.  |CITS: [stern66][17088549][20233924]|
/
/Under anaerobic conditions, fermentation of pyruvate via pyruvate-formate lyase and the pathway of |FRAME: FERMENTATION-PWY| is theoretically feasible, but that route does not produce enough ATP to compensate for the loss of ATP by utilization of the proton motive force during D-malate transport.  Thus, D-malate alone is unable to support growth as the sole source of carbon under anaerobic conditions |CITS: [20233924]|.

COMMENT - This multi-enzyme complex, which consists of 24 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 24 subunits of
/lipoate acetyltransferase, and 12 subunits of dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase, catalyzes three reactions,
/which constitute a cycle.  The complex contains a lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as
/a thiamin diphosphate. 
/
/The net consequence of the cycle, in addition to reducing NAD+, is the conversion of pyruvate into
/acetyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>, a key reaction of central metabolism because it links glycolysis I,
/which generates pyruvate, to the TCA cycle, into which the acetyl-CoA flows.
/
/During aerobic growth the cycle is an essential source of acetyl-CoA to feed the TCA cycle and thereby
/to satisfy the cellular requirements for the precursor metabolites it forms.  Mutant strains defective in the
/complex require an exogenous source of acetate to meet this requirement, but anaerobically such
/mutants grow without exogenous acetate because under such conditions, pyruvate formate lyase
/generates acetyl-CoA from pyruvate.  Mutant strains lacking pyruvate formate lyase have the reverse
/phenotype.  They require acetate for anaerobic but not for aerobic growth.

COMMENT - Acetate plays multiple roles in the metabolism of <i>E. coli</i>.  In the absence of other substrates
/acetate can serve as a total source of carbon and energy (see |FRAME: PWY0-1313|).
/
/During sugar fermentation (under anaerobic conditions), acetate is produced and excreted into the
/medium (by a mechanism that is not yet clearly established) as a major fermentation product.
/
/Acetate is also produced during aerobic growth in the presence of glucose. Again, acetate is excreted
/in significant amounts into the medium, usually to be utilized later, when glucose is depleted.
/
/The <i>ack-pta</i> pathway, which is constitutively expressed, can operate in both directions,
/and participates in both the aerobic utilization of acetate and in its production (both aerobically and
/anaerobically).

COMMENT - <H1>Aerobic pathway</H1>
/
/Although enzymes of the pathway handle both short and long chain fatty acids,
/it is the long chain compounds that induce the enzymes of the pathway |CITS: [6271734]|. 
/Each turn of the cycle removes two carbon atoms until
/only two or three remain.  When even-numbered fatty acids are broken down,
/a two-carbon compound remains,  acetylCoA.  When odd number fatty acids are 
/broken down, a three-carbon residue results, propionylCoA.  This is further
/catabolized by the reactions of proprionate catabolism. Unsaturated fatty
/acids, with cis double bonds located at odd-numbered carbon atoms, enter the
/main pathway of saturated fatty acid degradation by converting
/related metabolites of cis configuration and D stereoisomers, derived from
/breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids, to the trans- or L isomers of saturated
/fatty acid breakdown by an isomerase and an epimerase, respectively. When cis
/double bonds are located at even-numbered carbon atoms, such as linoleic acid
/(cis,cis(9,12)-octadecadienoic acid), after the fatty acid is degraded to the
/ten carbon stage an extra step is required to deal with the resulting compound,
/trans,&delta;(2)-cis,&delta;(4)decadienoyl-CoA.  The enzyme 2,4-dienoyl-CoA
/reductase, E.C. 1.3.1.34, converts this to trans,&delta;(2)decenoyl-CoA which enters the normal
/cycle at the point of the isomerase.
/
/<H1>Anaerobic pathway</H1>
/
/More recently, an anaerobic pathway of fatty acid metabolism has been characterized |CITS: [12535077]|.  Anaerobic
/&beta;-oxidation of fatty acids utilizes fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor |CITS: [15213221]|.  In contrast to
/the aerobic pathway, octanoate and decanoate can serve as substrates for the anaerobic fatty acid oxidation
/pathway |CITS: [12535077]|.  In the anaerobic pathway FadI, FadJ, and FadK serve functions parallel to those of
/FadA, FadB, and FadD in the aerobic pathway |CITS: [12535077]|.  
/
/The glyoxylate cycle is necessary for anaerobic or aerobic fatty acid oxidation to provide the carbon and energy for
/cell growth |CITS: [12535077]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| can serve as the sole source of carbon for <i>E. coli</i>.  Oleate is an
/unsaturated fatty acid and first undergoes two rounds of &beta;-oxidation (see |FRAME: FAO-PWY|),
/producing |FRAME: CPD0-1162|.  The original unsaturated bond is now located in the 5 position.
/
/While the majority of |FRAME: CPD0-1162| is completely degraded by further rounds of &beta;-oxidation,
/approximately 10% of the substrate enters a side pathway due to the production of a 3,5-unsaturated fatty
/acid, |FRAME: CPD0-1158|, from the 2,5-unsaturated |FRAME: CPD0-1162| by the enoyl-CoA isomerase
/activity of FadB.  |FRAME: CPD0-1158| can not be further metabolized by <i>E. coli</i>, since the
/organism lacks a &Delta;<sup>3,5</sup>,&Delta;<sup>2,4</sup>-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity. 
/Thioesterase III liberates the CoA moiety from |FRAME: CPD0-1158| by hydrolysis, thus avoiding the
/production of a dead-end compound that traps CoA.  The resulting |FRAME: CPD0-1159| is secreted into
/the growth medium.  |CITS: [14707139][18576672]|

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - |FRAME: TAX-83333| can synthesize |FRAME: GLT| from |FRAME: AMMONIA| in two ways.  In addition, if
/complex sources of nitrogen are available, other pathways become active and take over glutamate
/synthesis. 
/
/In the first pathway, |FRAME:GLT| is synthesized directly from |FRAME: AMMONIA|,
/|FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE|, and |FRAME: NADPH|, as described in |FRAME:GLUTSYNIII-PWY|.  
/
/The other pathway, which is described here, is a cyclic pathway, which consists of two steps.
/
/In the first step |FRAME: GLN| is synthesized from |FRAME: AMMONIA| and |FRAME: GLT| in an
/ATP-requiring reaction.
/
/|FRAME:GLUTAMINESYN-RXN| (EC 6.3.1.2)
/
/In the second step the amido group is transferred from |FRAME: GLN| to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|,
/yielding two molecules of |FRAME: GLT|.
/
/|FRAME:GLUTAMATESYN-RXN| (EC 1.4.1.13)
/
/Because the first reaction utilizes one molecule of glutamate, while the second reaction yields two
/molecules of glutamate, these two reactions function as a cycle, each turn of which utilizes one molecule
/each of |FRAME: AMMONIA|, |FRAME:ATP|, |FRAME:NADPH|, and |FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE|, and
/produces one molecule of |FRAME: GLT|.
/
/This pathway is active in energy-rich (glucose-containing), nitrogen-poor environments and is essential for
/nitrogen-limited growth and for steady-state growth with some sources of nitrogen |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Cyanate can occur inside the cell as a result of nonenzymatic decomposition of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, and in
/the environment due to dissociation of urea and photooxidation of cyanide.  Although cyanate at high concentrations
/is toxic to <i>E. coli</i>, it can serve as a sole source of nitrogen due to the production of ammonia by cyanase
/|CITS: [3034861]|.  The cyanate degradation pathway therefore serves the dual purpose of detoxification and nitrogen
/utilization |CITS: [7768821]|.  
/
/Cyanase catalyzes the first step of the pathway, producing CO<sub>2</sub> and the unstable compound carbamate. 
/Carbamate spontaneously decomposes to CO<sub>2</sub> and ammonia, thus producing a source of nitrogen for
/growth.  The second enzyme of this pathway, carbonic anhydrase, is an essential component of the pathway.  In the
/absence of carbonic anhydrase at atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, non-enzymatic hydration of
/CO<sub>2</sub> is not sufficient to prevent depletion of the intracellular bicarbonate pool due to rapid diffusion of
/CO<sub>2</sub> |CITS: [8444806]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can utilize alkanesulfonates as a sulfur source for growth.  Utilization of alkanesulfonate as well as methanesulfonate and L-cysteate requires the two-component alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system consisting of an NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase and an FMN-dependent alkanesulfonate monooxygenase |CITS: [10480865][11750815]|.
/
/Flavin cofactors are usually bound to proteins through strong covalent or non-covalent interactions; in this system, however, the flavin serves as a substrate for both enzymes and is not bound as a prosthetic group.  Thus, the transfer of the reduced flavin between the FMN reductase and the monooxygenase must be tightly controlled to prevent generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide, or hydroxyl radicals.  Recent studies showed kinetic interactions between the FMN reductase and the monooxygenase |CITS: [15882995]| and the formation of a stable complex between the two enzymes |CITS: [16997955]|.  These results support a model for direct transfer of the reduced flavin.

TYPES - Sulfur-Assimilation
COMMON-NAME - sulfate activation for sulfonation
CITATIONS - ROBBINS56
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The sulfonation of biological compounds (sulfoconjugation) is a fundamental metabolic process, in which a sulfate group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond. The sulfonation of biomolecules occurs widely and results in a dramatic change in the physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds |CITS: [Huxtable86]|. Sulfonation, is widely observed from bacteria to humans and plays a key role in various biological processes such as cell communication, growth and development, and defense |CITS: [11396917]|
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule |CITS: [13851709]|. The known forms of activated sulfate are adenosine 5-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulfate (PAPS) |CITS: [2828368]|. 
/
/Enzymatic reduction of sulfate requires its prior activation to a phosphosulfate-mixed anhydride, which in <i>E. coli</i> occurs through the ATP sulfurylase-catalyzed reaction of sulfate with ATP to give adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and PPi |CITS: [13575437]|. A second enzyme, APS kinase, phosphorylates APS with another ATP to give 3'-phosphoadenylsulfate (PAPS) |CITS: [Robbins56]|, which is then enzymatically reduced by PAPS sulfotransferase (also known as PAPS reductase) to sulfite. 
/
/ATP sulfurylase is encoded by <i>cysD</i> and <i>cysN</i>, and APS kinase is encoded by <i>cysC</i> with all three genes located in the <i>cys</i>DNC cluster |CITS: [2828368][1316900][3275623]|. The <i>E. coli</i> ATP sulfurylase enzyme has two nonidentical subunits, a 35-kDa catalytic subunit encoded by <i>cysD</i> and a 53-kDa peptide encoded by <i>cysN</i> |CITS: [2828368][1316900]|. The native enzyme is thought to contain four each of the two different subunits |CITS: [8117661]|. GTP stimulates the rate of APS synthesis as much as 116-fold with an apparent K<sub>m</sub> of 19 &micro;M and is hydrolyzed in the process |CITS: [1730615]|. When coupled with APS synthesis, GTP hydrolysis lowers the apparent K<sub>eq</sub> for the overall reaction by a factor of about 10<sup>5</sup> |CITS: [8299360][9521709]|. The enzyme mechanism involves the GTP-dependent formation of an AMP-enzyme reaction intermediate, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack by sulfate to give APS |CITS: [8117661]|. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> APS kinase is composed of identical 22-kDa peptides encoded by <i>cysC<i> |CITS: [2828368][1316900][1332767]|. The peptide subunit is phosphorylated by ATP at Ser-109 |CITS: [1332767]| and exists as a dimer in the phosphorylated state and mostly as a tetramer in the unphosphorylated state |CITS: [2549047]|. The phosphorylated enzyme probably represents an intermediate on the reaction pathway and can donate its phosphate either to APS to give the product PAPS or to ADP to re-form the substrate ATP.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <B>General Background</b>
/
/Sulfur is an essential nutrient for all life forms.  Plants, fungi, and many bacteria reduce inorganic sulfate to
/sulfide to cover their need for the element.  Before the sulfur can be assimilated into biosynthetic pathways
/it needs to be reduced to |FRAME:HS|.  Pathways catalyzing the reduction of sulfate to sulfide for the
/purpose of incorporation into newly synthesized molecules are called pathways of <b>assimilatory sulfate
/reduction</b>.  In addition, certain organisms can use sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor in the
/absence of oxygen.  Pathways of sulfate reduction for the purpose of energy production are called
/pathways of <b>dissimilatory sulfate reduction</b>.
/
/The reduction of sulfate to sulfite requires two electrons at a standard redox potential
/(<i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i>) of -516 mV, which is too high for physiological electron carriers |CITS: [860983]|. 
/The problem is solved by the activation of the sulfate, by forming a mixed anhydride between phosphate
/and sulfate as in |FRAME:APS| (APS) or |FRAME:PAPS| (PAPS).  This linkage lowers the potential to
/<i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i> = -60 mV, which is easily covered by thiols or pyrimidine nucleotides
/|CITS: [14627706]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In many bacteria and lower eukaryotes, assimilatory sulfate reduction proceeds via activation of
/|FRAME: SULFATE| to APS by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7428| (also known as ATP sulfurylase).  This
/enzyme has an unfavorable equilibrium (K<sub>eq</sub> ~ 10<sup>-7</sup> M) in the direction of APS
/formation, and it has been postulated that the reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of PP<sub>i</sub> by a
/ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase |CITS: [2821345]|.  In |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was found that the
/enzymes couples the formation of APS to hydrolysis of GTP |CITS: [8117661]|.
/
/Following sulfate activation, the pathway consists of phosphorylation of APS to PAPS, which is catalyzed
/by |FRAME: ADENYLYLSULFKIN-CPLX| (APS kinase), reduction to |FRAME: SO3|, which is catalyzed by
/the thioredoxin (or glutaredoxin)-dependent |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| (PAPS reductase), and a
/final reduction of sulfite to sulfide, catalyzed by a |FRAME:SULFITE-REDUCT-ENZRXN|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> can use all three naturally occurring pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides (deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, and
/thymidine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  Deoxyuridine and thymidine are cleaved by a specific
/phosphorylase, yielding a pyrimidine base and D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, which is converted to
/D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that also can utilize D-ribose-1-phosphate as a substrate.  A specific
/aldolase splits D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, yielding D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which enters central
/metabolism through the glycolytic pathway, and acetaldehyde, which must be converted to acetyl-CoA before it can
/enter central metabolism.  It does so via the TCA cycle.  In contrast, <i>E. coli</i> lacks a specific phosphorylase
/capable of cleaving deoxycytidine.  This nucleoside must be deaminated (thereby yielding deoxyuridine) before it can
/be cleaved.
/
/Although <i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize the deoxyribose moiety of deoxyribonucleosides, it is unable to utilize
/exogenously supplied deoxyribose; however, the closely related organism <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> can.
/
/The amino nitrogen of cytidine but not the ring-nitrogen of uracil or thymine, generated as by-products of this
/pathway, can serve as a total nitrogen source for <i>E. coli</i> over its entire temperature range of growth.  However,
/these ring nitrogens do become available to serve as total nitrogen sources at room temperature via a pathway
/encoded by genes in the <i>rut</i> operon |CITS: [16540542]|.

CITATIONS - 16540542:EV-EXP:3481639402:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidines can be catabolized through three different pathways.  The best characterized is the reductive pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6430| and |FRAME: PWY-3982|) in which pyrimidines are reduced to &beta;-amino acids, |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|.  The pathway is found in mammals, microorganisms and plants  |CITS: [13428755][13416173][8650301]|.  The oxidative pathway is only found in a few bacterial species and has not been characterized nearly as well.  In it uracil is converted to |FRAME: UREA| and |FRAME: MALONATE| via |FRAME: BARBITURATE| |CITS: [12981104][14955523]|.  A third pathway has recently been discovered in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [16540542]| and is described here.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i>E. coli</i> is able to utilize pyrimidine nucleosides and bases as the sole source of nitrogen at room temperature.  This novel pathway for pyrimidine degradation was discovered by a combination of functional and comparative genomics techniques including high-throughput microarray and phenotype analysis |CITS: [16540542]|.  The pathway depicted here represents a combination of experimental work and functional predictions based on the available evidence |CITS: [20400551]|.
/
/In the presence of a flavin reductase, |FRAME: G6523-MONOMER| catalyzes the first step in this pathway, the ring opening of uracil at the C4 carbonyl by a novel flavin hydroperoxide-catalyzed mechanism.  The initial product of the reaction appears to be |FRAME: CPD0-2338|, which is unstable and can be slowly reduced to ureidoacrylate |CITS: [20369853][20400551]|.  While the |FRAME: G6522-MONOMER "RutB"| enzyme is able to hydrolyze ureidoacrylate, it is thought to hydrolyze peroxyureidoacrylate <i>in vivo</i>, yielding carbamate and |FRAME: CPD0-2340|.  In a spontaneous reaction, carbamate decomposes into one molecule each of |FRAME: AMMONIA| and CO<sub>2</sub>.  The aminoacrylate peracid is thought to be reduced to aminoacrylate by the |FRAME: G6521-MONOMER|.  Aminoacrylate can then hydrolyze either spontaneously or enzymatically to  |FRAME: MALONATE-S-ALD| and a second molecule of ammonia.  Malonate semialdehyde appears to be toxic and can not be utilized further.  The compound may be detoxified by one of two malonic semialdehyde reductases to |FRAME: 3-HYDROXY-PROPIONATE|, which is then excreted into the medium.  The toxicity of malonic semialdehyde appears to limit growth on pyrimidines as the sole source of nitrogen.

COMMENT - Galactarate is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid analog of <i>D</i>-galactose.  <i>E. coli</i> can use both
/diacid sugars galactarate and <i>D</i>-glucarate as the sole source of carbon for growth.  The initial step in the
/degradation of galactarate is its dehydration to 5-keto-4-deoxy-<i>D</i>glucarate by
/|FRAME: GALACTARDEHYDRA-MONOMER|.  The subsequent steps in this pathway, cleavage of
/5-keto-4-deoxy-<i>D</i>glucarate into pyruvate and tartronate semialdehyde by |FRAME: CPLX0-7615|, reduction
/of tartronate semialdehyde to <i>D</i>-glycerate by |FRAME: TSA-REDUCT-MONOMER|, and phosphorylation of
/<i>D</i>-glycerate to form 2-phosphoglycerate by |FRAME: GKI-MONOMER|, are shared with the
/|FRAME: GLUCARDEG-PWY| pathway.

COMMON-NAME - galactitol degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Of the six existing hexitols only three (D-mannitol, D-sorbitol [glucitol], and galactitol [owing to symmetry,
/D- and L-galactitol are identical]) occur naturally and each of these can be utilized by <i>E. coli</i> K-12
/as a total source of carbon and energy.  Each enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system
/so the first intracellular species is the 6-phospho-derivative (in the case of galactitol,
/D-galactitol-1-phosphate and D-galactitol-6-phosphate are identical).  In all three cases this sugar alcohol
/phosphate becomes the substrate for a dehydrogenase that oxidizes its 2-alcohol group to a keto group. 
/In the cases of mannitol and sorbitol, the resulting keto sugar phosphate is D-fructose-6-phosphate, an
/intermediate of glycolysis and hence it flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the
/cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy.  In the case of
/galactitol-1-phosphate, however, the product of the dehydrogenation is tagatose-6-phosphate which
/becomes the substrate of a kinase and subsequently an aldolase (in a pair of reactions that parallel
/those of glycolysis) before it is converted into intermediates (D-glyceraldehde-3-phosphate and
/dihydroxy-acetone-phosphate) of glycolysis.

TYPES - Detoxification
COMMON-NAME - superoxide radicals degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses such as drought, air pollutants, UV light and high light intensities, chilling temperatures and external chemicals |CITS: [VANBREUSGEM99][11997379]|. For example, active oxygen species are produced during the &beta;-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms |CITS: [8819328]|. ROS such as |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| and hydroxyl radicals as well as |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| can cause significant damage to proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles. 
/
/Most of the aerobic organisms have developed defense systems to face oxidative stress and to scavenge oxidative radicals in the form of enzymes that can detoxify ROS, such as |FRAME: SUPEROX-DISMUTMN-ENZRXN| (SOD) and |FRAME: HYDROPEROXIDI-ENZRXN| (CAT) |CITS: [BEYER87]|. SODs represent the first line of defense against ROS, converting |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| radicals to |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and water. SODs are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor. There are iron-dependent, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SODs, which differ not only in their metal cofactor but also in their subcellular location. Catalase is second in the defense line against active oxygen, converting |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| into water and oxygen.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Gram-negative bacteria commonly synthesize both cytoplasmic and periplasmic isozymes of SOD as their frontline defense against superoxide anion(O<sub>2</sub>-).  <i>E. coli</i> contains two cytoplasmic SOD isozymes, one each of the manganese- and iron-cofactored types (Mn-SOD and FeSOD). MnSOD is strongly induced when <i>E. coli</i> is exposed to redox-cycling antibiotics. <i>E. coli</i> also secretes a single copper, zinc-cofactored enzyme (CuZnSOD) to the periplasm. <i>E. coli</i> synthesizes just enough SOD activity to protect vulnerable enzymes from endogenous superoxide. Periplasmic SOD in <i>E. coli</i> enzyme serves to defend unidentified periplasmic targets from O<sub>2</sub>- that leaks from respiratory-chain components on the outer aspect of the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [18173371]|. 
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, MnSOD and FeSOD enzymes (encoded by <i>sodA</i> and <i>sodB</i> genes, respectively) are structurally and kinetically similar. When iron is abundant, FeSOD is synthesized and is activated by iron, while the iron-charged Fur repressor inhibits transcription of <i>sodA</i> |CITS: [11917098]|. Conversely, when iron is scarce, <i>sodA</i> expression is derepressed and the manganese transporter MntH is induced, leading to high titers of active MnSOD |CITS: [8449876]|. The <i>E. coli</i> Cu,Zn-SOD, encoded by <i>sodC</i>, appears to be unusual in that it is monomeric, rather than being dimeric as are other Cu,Zn-SODs |CITS: [9228011]|. 
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, with rising H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, catalase is strongly induced and becomes the primary scavenging enzyme. <i>E. coli</i> expresses two catalases, known as HPI and HPII, that are encoded by katG and katE, respectively. While <i>katG katE</i> mutants could not degrade millimolar concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, they were subsequently found to retain the ability to degrade H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when it was present at low micromolar concentrations |CITS: [11717276]|. This residual activity is due to an enzyme known as alkylhydroperoxide reductase (Ahp). This two-component enzyme had originally been identified as a scavenger of organic hydroperoxides |CITS: [2643600]|. 
/
/SOD mutants of <i>E. coli</i> are unable to perform normal sulfur metabolism. Both SOD and catalase/peroxidase mutants of <i>E. coli</i> are incapable of synthesizing aromatic products, including amino acids |CITS: [18173371]|. 
/
/SoxRS regulon is turned on by any condition that increases superoxide radical production in <i>E. coli</i>. One of its products includes: Mn-SOD. Another independent regulon turned on in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is referred to as the OxyR regulon |CITS: [9228011]|.

COMMENT - Enteric bacteria must be able to survive extremely acidic conditions in order pass through the
/stomachs of their hosts.  <I>E. coli</I> contains acid resistance systems in order to maintain
/an internal pH of about 4.0 to 5.0 in a highly acidic environment with a pH of 2.0 to 2.5.  Acid
/resistance system 3 (AR3) is the arginine-dependent acid resistance system which couples
/the transport activity of an arginine:agmatine antiporter, AdiC, with arginine decarboxylase, AdiA. 
/AdiC functions by exchanging external arginine for internal agmatine.  Arginine is imported into
/the cell through AdiC.  Within the cell arginine is decarboxylated by AdiA to agmatine, releasing
/CO<sub>2</sub> and replacing it with a proton.  Agmatine is then exported through AdiC. 
/This effectively consumes protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  An additional effect
/of the acid resistance systems that may be more important for survival is a reversal of the
/membrane potential such that a build-up of positive charges within the cell due to influx of protons
/and increased agmatine concentrations will counteract proton influx beyond a certain limit. 
/ClC chloride channels provide a control mechanism to help maintain appropriate membrane
/potential by mediating chloride import coupled to proton export.  AR2 is more efficient than AR3
/or AR4 as a mediator of acid resistance at low pH. |CITS:[15494746],[12964244]|

COMMENT - Enteric bacteria must be able to survive extremely acidic conditions in order pass through the
/stomachs of their hosts.  <I>E. coli</I> contains acid resistance systems in order to maintain
/an internal pH of about 4.0 to 5.0 in a highly acidic environment with a pH of 2.0 to 2.5.  Acid
/resistance system 2 (AR2) is the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system which couples
/the transport activity of a glutamate:4-aminobutyrate antiporter, GadC, with glutamate
/decarboxylase, GadA/GadB.  GadA or GadB is sufficient for survival at pH 2.5, but both GadA and GadB
/are required for survival at pH 2.0.  GadC functions by exchanging external glutamate for internal
/4-aminobutyrate.  Glutamate is imported into the cell through GadC.  Within the cell glutamate is

COMMON-NAME - Entner-Doudoroff pathway I
CITATIONS - 9657988:EV-EXP-TAS:3315251615:caspi
COMMENT - The Entner-Doudoroff pathway joins the |FRAME:OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY| to glycolysis
/via two steps, catalyzed by inducible enzymes. 
/
/This pathway is important to <i>E. coli</i> because sugar acids, which are significant nutrients in both of
/its habitats, intestinal and aquatic, are metabolized via this pathway.  Strains that are mutationally
/blocked in this pathway are unable to grow on gluconate, glucuronate, or galacturonate and are also
/unable to colonize the mouse intestine |CITS: [8751891]|.  The uronic acids feed into the pathway's sole
/intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phospho-gluconate so the dependence of their metabolism on an intact
/Entner-Doudoroff pathway is clear |CITS: [9657988]|.  The dependence of gluconate's metabolism on an
/intact Entner-Doudoroff pathway is less obvious because it is also metabolized via the pentose phosphate
/pathway.
/
/Enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway are induced by growth on gluconate, glucuronate, or
/methyl-&beta;-D-glucuronide; phosphate or carbon limitation |CITS: [15659677]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3427574405:lnolan
COMMENT - In the respiratory chain formed by formate dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase the transfer of electrons
/from formate to nitrate is coupled to the generation of a proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic
/membrane.
/
/Two electrons are transferred from the formate oxidation site in formate dehydrogenase in
/the periplasm to the nitrate reduction site of nitrate reductase in the cytoplasm by a menaquinone pool
/which drives proton translocation in the opposite direction |CITS: [4905536], [4616697]|. 
/
/Two of <i>E. coli</i>'s formate dehydrogenases, N and O, catalyse the oxidation of formate. 
/Expression of formate dehydrogenase N (Fdh-N) is induced by anaerobiosis and the presence of 
/nitrate |CITS: [12923080], [2168848]| whereas aerobic conditions, and to a lesser extent nitrate under
/anaerobic conditions, induce expression of formate dehydrogenase O (Fdh-O) |CITS: [8522521]|. 
/
/Two of the nitrate reductases, A and Z, in <i>E. coli</i> are membrane-bound and act as terminal
/electron acceptors. Expression of nitrate reductase A (NRA) occurs in response to high levels of nitrate
/in the environment whereas expression of nitrate reductase Z (NRZ) is not dependent on nitrate levels or
/anaerobiosis |CITS: [10464201]|. 
/
/Fdh-N and NRA are coupled together in the formate to nitrate electron transfer pathway when levels of
/nitrate are high. Fdn-O and NRZ also couple together, although it is thought that these enzymes are
/expressed in the transition between aerobic and anaerobic conditions until the alternate enzymes reach
/sufficiently high levels to function in the respiratory chain |CITS: [8522521]|.

COMMON-NAME - succinate to cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase electron transfer
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3445031505:keseler
COMMENT - In the respiratory chain formed by succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase the
/transfer of electrons from succinate to cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase is coupled to the generation of a
/proton-motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane. 
/
/Succinate is oxidised to fumarate resulting in production of four electrons which are transferred to the
/cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase by a quinone pool which drives proton translocation in the opposite
/direction. Neither succinate dehydrogenase or cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase catalyse vectorial proton
/translocation, instead the reduction of oxygen by cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidase contributes four protons
/to the proton-motive force. 
/
/<i>E. coli</i> has two cytochrome <i>bd</i> oxidases. Cytochrome <i>bd</i>-I is expressed in wild-type
/cells under conditions of limited oxygen |CITS: [389237]|. Cytochrome <i>bd</i>-II is expressed only in
/mutants lacking cytochrome <i>bd</i>-I and cytochrome <i>bo</i> with cytochrome <i>bd</i> activity
/being observed only when complemented with a chromosomal fragment from <i>Bacillus firmus</i>
/|CITS: [8626304]|. The physiological role of cytochrome <i>bd</i>-II in wild-type <i>E. coli</i> is obscure. 
/
/Succinate dehydrogenase is expressed in aerobic conditions and is structurally and functionally
/homologous to fumarate dehydrogenase |CITS: [2168848]|.

COMMON-NAME - pyruvate oxidation pathway
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3442873052:keseler
COMMENT - This pathway is one of three by which pyruvate, largely derived from glycolysis, is cleaved.  Under
/conditions of aerobic growth, most pyruvate is cleaved by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
/[see Pathway: acetyl-CoA biosynthesis (from pyruvate)] to CO2 and acetyl-CoA.  Anaerobically it is
/cleaved via pyruvate formate lyase (see Pathway: mixed acid fermentation).  The physiological role of this
/third (PoxB) route, which yields acetate and CO2, is mysterious because it yields acetate rather than
/acetyl-CoA and is, therefore, energetically wasteful.  However, the pathway does play some useful
/metabolic role because mutant strains lacking PoxB activity grow more slowly and yield a lesser crop of
/cells |CITS: [11390679]|.  PoxB expression, under the control of RpoS, is increased as cultures enter
/stationary phase.  Greater quantities of acetate accumulate and the ace (acetate conversion to acetyl-CoA)
/pathway is induced.  Perhaps this pathway functions as a "safety valve" to maintain acetyl-CoA at optimum
/intracellular levels.

COMMENT - <i>Escherichia coli</i>, a facultative anaerobe, is capable of mediating the mixed acid fermentation and
/thereby, in the absence of any of the exogenous electron acceptors that it can utilize (oxygen, fumarate,
/nitrate, nitrite, trimethylamine oxide, or dimethyl sulfoxide), able to grow on a variety of compounds
/including hexoses, hexitols, hexonic acids, and hexuronic acids.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> ferments only when exogenous electron acceptors are not available.  In the shift from
/exogenous electron-dependent growth to the mixed acid fermentation, pyruvate dehydrogenase is no
/longer synthesized.  Instead, pyruvate formate-lyase, which cleaves pyruvate nonoxidatively to
/formate and acetyl-CoA, is made.  Formate is excreted as formic acid.  Some of the acetyl-CoA enters the
/remnant of the TCA cycle, which terminates at 2-oxoglutarate because 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
/synthesis is repressed.  In spite of such repression, all components of the TCA cycle and therefore its
/essential precursor metabolites, continue to be made by the now two arms of the cycle: one, leading to
/2-oxoglutarate, still oxidatively, and the other, leading to succinate, now reductively.  Succinate is
/excreted as succinic acid.  The acetyl-CoA not needed for these purposes is metabolized via
/acetylphosphate to acetate, thereby generating ATP.  The acetate so formed is excreted as acetic acid.
/
/During the shift to the mixed acid fermentation, three additional enzymes are made: 1) a lactate
/dehydrogenase, which reduces pyruvate to lactate that is excreted as lactic acid; 2) an ethanol
/dehydrogenase, which reduces acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde and subsequently to ethanol, which is
/excreted; 3) formic hydrogen lyase, which cleaves formate to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.  The multiplicity of
/possible endproducts of fermentation with differing oxidation states and acidity permits <i>E. coli</i> to
/maintain redox balance and therefore to grow fermentatively on a broader range of substrates than would
/otherwise be possible.  When growing on a more reduced substrate such as glucitol, greater quantities of
/more reduced endproducts such as ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid are produced; on more oxidized
/substrates such as glucuronate, more of the oxidized endproducts, succinic acid and formic acid, are
/made.  Conversion of formate to H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> is regulated by pH.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components
/of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the
/|FRAME:TCA|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth
/because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|,
/|FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|,
/|FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) of the 13 precursor metabolites
/that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other
/needed small molecules. 
/Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.
/
/Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions:
/
/ i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and
/
/ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it
/can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
/
/Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, 
/glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source
/being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites.
/This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising
/glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered
/functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|)
/that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Glucose is not shown here as a component of glycolysis because when used by <i>E. coli</i> as a source
/of carbon and energy, glucose enters the cell via a phosphotransferase system
/(transport of glucose, |FRAME: CPLX-157|), the first intracellular species, therefore,
/being glucose-6-phosphate.
/<i>E. coli</i> does constitutively produce |FRAME:GLUCOKIN-MONOMER| (the intracellular enzyme that
/converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate) but it is not needed for the utilization of either exogenous or
/endogenous glucose |CITS: [9023215]|.
/under anabolic stress conditions, it may be required to supplement levels of glucose 6-phosphate
/|CITS: [7786044]|.

CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The pentose phosphate pathway (see "|FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY|") is one of the three essential
/pathways of central metabolism.  The pentose phosphate pathway supplies three of <i>E. coli</i>'s 13
/precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): D-ribose-5-phosphate,
/sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/<i>E. coli</i> is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the
/cell's requirements for these metabolites.  In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH,
/which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis,
/glucose-6-phosphate, and ends with the formation of two others, fructose-6-phosphate and
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary oxidative
/portion in which glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to ribulose-5-phosphate, and its subsequent
/non-oxidative portion, shown here, in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions,
/ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

COMMENT - The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY| is one of the three essential
/pathways of central metabolism.  The pentose phosphate pathway supplies three of <i>E. coli</i>'s 13
/precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): D-ribose-5-phosphate,
/sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/<i>E. coli</i> is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the
/cell's requirements for these metabolites.  In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH,
/which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis,
/glucose-6-phosphate, and ends with the formation of two others, fructose-6-phosphate and
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary oxidative
/portion, shown here, in which glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to ribose-5-phosphate, and its subsequent
/non-oxidative portion in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions,
/ribose-5-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

TYPES - ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION
COMMON-NAME - respiration (anaerobic)
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - Respiration is an ATP-generating process in which organic compounds act as 
/electron donors (see anaerobic respiration electron donor list) through a chain
/of electron transfer to electron acceptors.  Anaerobic respiration uses several
/compounds, both organic and inorganic, as acceptors such as fumarate, 
/nitrate and hydrogen (see anaerobic respiration electron acceptor list).  By 
/contrast, aerobic respiration uses oxygen as the final acceptor.
/During the chain of electron transfer, protons (H+) are transported outside the
/cytoplasmic membrane, generating a proton motive force.  Upon passage of protons
/back into the cytoplasm, the PMF energy is captured as ATP, catalyzed by a 
/multisubunit ATPase.

UNIQUE-ID - GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS
TYPES - TCA-VARIANTS
COMMON-NAME - glyoxylate cycle
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277587223:pkarp
COMMENT - The glyoxylate cycle is a sequence of anaplerotic reactions that enables an organism to use substrates
/that enter central carbon metabolism at the level of |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| as the sole carbon source. 
/Such substrates include fatty acids, alcohols, and esters (often the products of fermentation), as well as
/waxes, alkenes, and methylated compounds.
/
/The pathway is essentially a modified version of the |FRAME:TCA| that bypasses those steps in the cycle
/that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  The glyoxylate cycle uses a two-step bypass.  The first
/key enzyme, |FRAME:ISOCIT-LYASE| (EC 4.1.3.1), converts |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to form
/|FRAME: SUC| and |FRAME: GLYOX|.  The second key enzyme, |FRAME: MALATE-SYNTHASE|
/(EC 2.3.3.9), condenses glyoxylate and another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form |FRAME:MAL|.  The
/subsequent oxidation of malate regenerates the initial acetyl-CoA acceptor molecule of the TCA cycle,
/|FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|.  In this way any intermediate of the TCA cycle can be withdrawn from the
/cycle and used for cell carbon biosynthesis.
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the pathway is active when growth on two-carbon compounds requires
/conservation of four-carbon TCA intermediates.  Two acetyl-CoA are taken up per turn.  The glyoxylate
/cycle is repressed during growth on glucose and induced by growth on acetate
/|CITS: [2512996][6378912][6389540][6329757]|.
/
/Acetyl-CoA is generated by |FRAME: PWY0-1313| or by &beta; oxidation of fatty acids.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 the PhoQP two component system acts as a transcriptional regulator that responds to Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation and may play a role in survival in Mg<sup>2+</sup> limiting environments. PhoQ is the membrane associated sensor kinase which phosphorylates its response regulator PhoP, in response to low levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The PhoP regulon is large and includes genes with functions in magnesium transport,  acid resistance and lipopolysaccharide modification. Interaction between the PhoQP and |FRAME: PWY0-1490 "EvgSA"| two-component systems has been observed in <i>E.coli</i> and is mediated by the small protein |FRAME: MONOMER0-2841 "B1500"|. |CITS: [10464230], [12813061], [15126461]|.
/
/PhoQP has been widely studied in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar <i>typhimurium</i> where it controls several virulence properties (reviewed in |CITS: [18792679]|. PhoP and PhoQ from <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. typhimurium</i> are 93% and 86% identical respectively.

COMMON-NAME - QseBC Two-Component Signal Transduction System, quorum sensing related
COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i> K-12, QseBC is thought to be a quorum sensing two-component system (TCS) involved in regulation of flagella biogenesis through activation of the |FRAME: CPLX0-3930 "<i>flhDC</i>"| operon - the principal regulator of flagellar biogenesis |CITS: [11929534]|. QseC is the membrane associated sensor kinase; QseB the response regulator. Characterisation of the QseBC TCS has been largely undertaken in enterohaemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> (EHEC) where it forms part of the signalling cascade that activates expression of virulence genes including those that control flagella expression. <i>qseB</i> and <i>qseC</i> from EHEC and <i>E. coli</i> K-12 are almost identical |CITS: [11929534]|.
/
/The <i>E coli</i> K-12 <i>qseBC</i> operon is activated by the AI-2 quorum sensing system but a direct effect of the AI-2 molecule on the phosphorylation status of QseC has not been demonstrated |CITS: [11929534]|. In EHEC autophosphorylation of QseC in response to the auto-inducer AI-3, has been reported |CITS: [16803956]| and the response regulator QseB has been shown to bind to the <i>flhDC</i> promoter |CITS: [16135237]|.

COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i>, two-component systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Typically a membrane associated histidine kinase (HK) autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The HK then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E.coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The AtoSC two-component system comprises |FRAME: ATOS-MONOMER| - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and |FRAME: ATOC-MONOMER "AtoC"| - the cytoplasmic response regulator. AtoSC is best characterised as the two-component system that induces the <i>ato</i> operon (<i>atoDAEB</i>) for metabolism of short chain fatty acids in response to the presence of acetoacetate |CITS: [2883171], [16153782]|. The physiological  significance of the Ato system is likely to be more complex as AtoSC mediated regulation of  poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB) biosynthesis |CITS:[8703033], [16564134]| and a role in flagellar synthesis and chemotactic response have been reported |CITS: [12366850]|.

COMMON-NAME - PhoRB Two-Component Signal Transduction System, phosphate-dependent
CITATIONS - 2693738:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3486243563:amackie
COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i> K-12, PhoRB is the two-component system for sensing and responding to variations in the level of extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi). Pho RB regulates the expression of a large number of genes (the Pho regulon) which have a role in the assimilation of environmental Pi or the use of alternate Pi sources.
/
/PhoR is the membrane associated sensor kinase which controls activity of the cytoplasmic response regulator and transcription factor PhoB. PhoR detects Pi only indirectly and its activity as a sensor kinase depends on its association with the phosphate transporter |FRAME: ABC-27-CPLX "PstSCAB"| and/or |FRAME: EG10735-MONOMER "PhoU"|. Accordingly signal transduction by Pi requires seven proteins (PhoR, PhoB, PstSCAB and PhoU) that interact in a membrane associated complex. 
/
/PhoRB signalling is believed to be a negative process - that is, activation of PhoB is the default state and excess environmental Pi is required to turn the system off. Under limiting environmental Pi, PhoR is believed to be in an active signalling conformation resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of PhoB and subsequent induction of the Pho regulon. Excess levels of Pi (>4uM) result in an inhibited form of PhoR which interferes with phosphorylation of PhoB and prevents its activity as a transcription factor. The Pst transporter and the chaperone like protein PhoU are both necessary for inhibition of the PhoRB system.

COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two component systems (TCSs) sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Typically, a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E. coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The Cpx TCS comprises the membrane associated sensor CpxA and the cytoplasmic response regulator, CpxR. The Cpx system is believed to be a stress response pathway that activates proteases and folding proteins in response to cell envelope damage |CITS: [9159398]|. The size of the Cpx regulon is large - dozens of target genes have been identified with functions relating to chemotaxis, multidrug efflux, DNA repair, bacterial adherance and motility.

COMMENT - The CreCB two-component system consists of the membrane associated sensor kinase CreC and the cytoplasmic response regulator CreB. The CreCB regulon includes genes with diverse functions leading to the suggestion that it is a global regulator |CITS: [11350954]|. CreCB regulates the expression of target genes when cells are fermenting glycolytic carbon sources in minimal media and during aerobic growth on gluconeogenic carbon sources, however the specific ligand activating CreC is not currently known |CITS: [18375564]|.
/
/CreC was initially called PhoM as it was shown to transphosphorylate PhoB in PhoR mutant strains in response to glucose |CITS: [7021308], [2228961]|. Other carbon sources were able to mimic the effect of glucose |CITS: [1551836]| and PhoM was renamed CreC (carbon source responsive).

COMMENT - The EvgSA two component signal transduction system (TCS) comprises |FRAME: EVGS-MONOMER "EvgS"| - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and |FRAME: EVGA-MONOMER "EvgA"| - the cytoplasmic response regulator. The EvgSA TCS is believed to initiate a complex transcriptional cascade that functions for acid and drug resistance in <i>E.coli</i> |CITS: [19352034]|. The EvgA regulon has been experimentally determined but the environmental signal sensed by EvgS remains obscure.
/
/EvgS is a member of the 'unorthodox' sensor kinase class where a multistep phosphorelay occurs between alternating histidine and aspartate residues before the EvgA response regulator is activated |CITS: [8808618]| 
/
/Interaction between the EvgSA and |FRAME: PWY0-1458 "PhoQP"| two-component systems has been observed in <i>E.coli</i> and is mediated by the small protein |FRAME: MONOMER0-2841 "B1500"| |CITS: [15126461], [17998538], [18792678]|.

COMMENT - The UhpBA two-component signal transduction system (TCS) forms part of the <i>E. coli</i> Uhp system which is responsible for sensing and transport of the metabolic intermediate, glucose-6-phosphate. Sensing of external glucose-6-phosphate by this system involves the two inner membrane proteins |FRAME: UHPC-MONOMER "UhpC"| and UhpB which appear to act jointly  in the signalling process |CITS: [1569007], [8349544]|. UhpC is thought to act as the receptor for glucose-6-phosphate and to subsequently interact with UhpB, stimulating its kinase activity and resulting in the transfer of a phosphoryl group to the soluble transcription factor UhpA. The precise nature of the interaction between UhpC and UhpB is not known. Phosphorylated UhpA binds target sequences in the <i>uhpT</i> promoter and induces its expression |CITS: [3042748], [8999880]|. The inner membrane UhpT protein can transport a variety of phosphorylated sugars including glucose-6-phosphate |CITS: [2181257]|.

COMMENT - In <i>E.coli</i> K-12 the Rcs proteins are involved in a complex phosphorelay system that is believed to play a role in controlling the temporal expression of genes related to biofilm formation and may have a broader role as a global regulator controlling cell surface composition in response to changing environments. Numerous conditions that activate the Rcs phosphorelay have been observed including osmotic shock, dessication and perturbations in the integrity of the cell membrane. The Rcs regulon is large and includes genes for colonic acid capsule synthesis, cell division, motility and membrane lipoproteins. 
/
/The Rcs phosphorelay involves three separate proteins: RcsC, RcsD and RcsB. Phosphate transfer occurs from the sensor kinase RcsC, which autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal, to RcsD and then to the cytoplasmic transcription factor RcsB. RcsB, either alone or in combination with RscA, activates transcription from a wide range of genes, including those for capsule synthesis and some membrane proteins, and it negatively regulates flagella synthesis. An auxillary protein, the outer membrane lipoprotein |FRAME: RCSF-MONOMER "RcsF"|, is believed play a role in signal transduction from the cell surface to RscC.

COMMENT - <i>Escherichia coli</i> uses several systems to adjust the concentration of the dominant intracellular cation, K<sup>+</sup>. Under physiological conditions the constitutively expressed K<sup>+</sup> transporters |FRAME: PC-52 "Trk"| and |FRAME: KUP-MONOMER "Kup"| are active but upon osmotic upshock or under K<sup>+</sup> limiting conditions the high affinity  K<sup>+</sup> transporter |FRAME: ATPASE-1-CPLX "KdpFABC"| is induced. Expression of KdpFABC is under control of the KdpDE two-component system.
/
/KdpD is a membrane-bound sensor kinase whose autophosphorylation is believed to be affected by changes in the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration and ionic strength. Phosphorylated KdpD transfers a phosphoryl group to the cytoplasmic response regulator KdpE, which thus activated, induces expression of the <i>KdpFABC</i> operon.

COMMON-NAME - BarA UvrY Two-Component Signal Transduction System
CITATIONS - 11022030:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3489460356:amackie
COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, two-component regulatory systems sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions.  In the prototypical system a membrane associated sensor kinase autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal. The sensor kinase then transfers a phosphoryl group to a response regulator (RR) which, thus activated, effects a response. The majority of RRs in <i>E.coli</i> are transcription factors.
/
/The BarA/UvrY two-component system comprises BarA - the membrane associated sensor kinase - and UvrY - the cytoplasmic response regulator. The physiological role of the BarA/UvrY two-component system is not well characterised but it is believed to participate in an autoregulatory loop with the CsrA/CsrB system that coordinates central carbon metabolism. Specifically CsrA activates <i>uvrY</i>, which activates transcription of <i>csrB</i>, and CsrB RNA inhibits CsrA activity |CITS:  [12193630]|.  UvrY-mediated <i>csrB</i> activation is partially dependent on BarA |CITS:  [12193630]|. Autophosphorylation of BarA has been demonstrated in vitro as has the transfer of phosphate from phosphorylated BarA to UvrY |CITS: [11022030]|.

COMMENT - The ArcAB two-component system mediates <i>E. coli's</i> response to  changing respiratory conditions of growth and is a global regulator of gene expression under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. The system comprises ArcB - a membrane associated sensor kinase and phosphatase, and ArcA - a cytosolic transcription factor. Under anaerobiosis ArcB autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates ArcA via a four step His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay. Activated ArcA regulates the expression of numerous operons involved in respiratory and fermentative metabolism. During aerobiosis oxidised forms of quinone electron carriers signal the inhibition of  ArcB autophosphorylation and ArcB acts as a specific ArcA-P phosphatase.

COMMENT - In the absence of oxygen <i>E.coli</i> K-12 is able to generate energy using a variety of different substances as terminal electron acceptors. One such substance is trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) which, under anaerobic conditions, is reduced to TMA by the action of the periplasmic molybdoprotein |FRAME: TMAOREDUCTI-CPLX "TMAO reductase"|, encoded by the <i>TorCAD</i> genes. TorSR is the two-component signal transduction system that controls the cells ability to use TMAO as an alternate electron acceptor. TorS is the membrane associated sensor kinase which detects the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the medium and phosphorylates its cognate response regulator, TorR. Thus activated, phosphorylated TorR binds to a region upstream of TorC and induces the <i>torCAD</i> operon. TorR has also been shown to  regulate the expression of genes involved in the response to extreme pH leading to the suggestion that the TorSR system also triggers alkaline stress defence mechanisms to counteract the increasing pH resulting from TMA production.
/
/The periplasmic |FRAME: G6515 "TorT"| protein acts upstream of the TorSR two-component system. TorT binds to TMAO and interacts with the periplasmic domain of TorS thus suggesting that the TorS activating signal may be a TMAO-TorT complex.

CITATIONS - 2874557:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3492397660:amackie
COMMENT - The NtrBC two-component system controls transcription of the <i>Ntr</i> regulon in E. coli - a collection of genes whose products facilitate survival under nitrogen limited growth conditions. The <i>Ntr</i> regulon is large and includes genes whose products assimilate ammonia, scavange nitrogen-containing compounds and integrate nitrogen assimilation with other metabolic processes.
/
/NtrB (NRII), encoded by <i>glnL</i>, is a dual function cytoplasmic protein with both histidine kinase and phosphatase activity. Depending on nitrogen availability, NtrB can autophosphorylate and donate a phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator, NtrC (NRI, product of <i>glnG</i>), or it may act as a phosphatase and catalyse the rapid dephosphorylation of NtrC-P. The phosphatase and kinase activities of NtrB are regulated by the homologous signal proteins |FRAME: PROTEIN-PII "PII"| (<i>GlnB</i>) and |FRAME: PII2-CPLX "PII2"| (<i>GlnK</i>) and the |FRAME: EG11411 "uridyyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme"| (product of <i>GlnD</i>). Phosphorylated NtrC activates transcription of numerous genes and operons - whose products include |FRAME: GLUTAMINESYN-OLIGOMER "glutamine synthetase"| (GS), transporters, amino acid permeases and catabolic enzymes which function collectively to facilitate survival under nitrogen limitation.

/Typically, two component systems comprise a membrane associated sensor kinase which autophosphorylates in response to an environmental signal and transfers a phosphoryl group to a cytoplasmic response regulator which thus activated, effects a response. The CusSR two-component system comprises CusS - the membrane associated sensor kinase and CusR - the cytoplasmic transcriptional activator. The specific activating signal for CusS is unclear but may be Cu<sup>1+</sup> accumulation in the periplasm |CITS: [11399769]|.

COMMENT - <i>E. coli</i> movement is typically described as a random three-dimensional walk in which runs of movement in a straight line are punctuated by tumbles as the cell briefly stops and randomly reorients before moving off again. This swimming/tumbling behaviour results from alternating clockwise (tumbling behavior) and counterclockwise (straight swimming behavior) flagellar rotation. Chemotaxis is the ability of <i>E. coli</i> to move or 'swim' towards or away from specific chemical attractants and repellents and is achieved by regulating the probability of CW and CCW flagella rotation via a modified two-component signal transduction pathway - the chemotactic signal transduction pathway. Pathway components include the dual function histidine kinase |FRAME: CHEA-CPLX "CheA"|, the response regulators |FRAME: CHEY-MONOMER "CheY"| and |FRAME: CHEB-MONOMER "CheB"|, plus |FRAME: CHEW-MONOMER "CheW"|, |FRAME: CHER-MONOMER "CheR"|, and the transmembrane receptor proteins.
/
/CheA is a dual function cytoplasmic histidine kinase which, in conjunction with one of the transmembrane receptor proteins  (the so-called methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins - |FRAME: TSR-MONOMER "Tsr"|, |FRAME: TAR-MONOMER "Tar"|, |FRAME: TRG-MONOMER "Trg"| or |FRAME: TAP-MONOMER "Tap"|) and a linker protein CheW, forms a ternery signalling complex (|FRAME: TSR-CPLX "MCPI"|, |FRAME: TAR-CPLX "MCPII"|, |FRAME: TRG-CPLX "MCPIII"| or |FRAME: TAP-CPLX "MCPIV"|). Ligands interact with the receptor proteins and affect the flow of phosphoryl groups from CheA to two response regulators - CheY and CheB - neither of these proteins are transcription factors unlike the majority of two-component response regulators in <i>E. coli</i>. CheY influences flagella rotation by direct binding to the |FRAME: FLIM-FLAGELLAR-C-RING-SWITCH "FliM"| protein - a component of the |FRAME: CPLX0-7450 "flagella motor switch complex"|. CheY and phosphoCheY  bind to FliM with different affinities and influence the direction of flagellar rotation. CheB is a methylesterase which, along with CheR methyltransferase takes part in a feedback loop that  enables the pathway to adapt to background stimuli.

COMMENT - Energy taxis is the ability of bacteria to monitor their internal energy levels and respond by moving to a position that is optimal for their metabolic requirements. In <i>E. coli</i> energy taxis encompasses aerotaxis (response to an oxygen gradient) and redox taxis (response to a redox gradient). The molecular mechanisms of energy taxis are closely related to those of chemotaxis whereby bacteria respond to specific chemical attractants and repellents in their external environment (see |FRAME: PWY0-1518 "chemotactic two-component signal transduction"|). 
/
/Energy taxis in <i>E. coli</i> is achieved by a signal transduction system that responds to changes in the electron transport system. Two receptors sense changes in the ET system: Aer and Tsr. Aer senses changes in the redox state of the system via an FAD cofactor while  Tsr senses changes in proton motive force that result from perturbation of the ET system. Signals from Aer and Tsr are transduced via the CheA, CheW and CheY proteins, to the flagellar apparatus. CheY influences flagella rotation by direct binding to the |FRAME: FLIM-FLAGELLAR-C-RING-SWITCH "FliM"| protein - a component of the |FRAME: CPLX0-7450 "flagella motor switch complex"|. CheY and phosphoCheY  bind to FliM with different affinities, influencing the direction of flagellar rotation and facilitating movement.

UNIQUE-ID - ALL-CHORISMATE-PWY
TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - superpathway of chorismate
COMMENT - Chorismate is the principal common precursor of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, as well as the essential compounds tetrahydrofolate, ubiquinone-8, menaquinone-8 and enterobactin (enterochelin).  The pathway from D-erythrose-4-phosphate to chorismate is known as the common pathway, or shikimate pathway.  A review of the elucidation of the common pathway and its terminal pathway branches to the aromatic amino acids can be found in the reference below.

UNIQUE-ID - FUC-RHAMCAT-PWY
TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - superpathway of fucose and rhamnose degradation
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3402940001:keseler
COMMENT - In <i>E. coli</i>, L-fucose and L-rhamnose are metabolized through parallel pathways.  The pathways converge after
/their corresponding aldolase reactions yielding the same products: dihydoxy-acetone phosphate (which enters
/central metabolism directly via the glycolysis pathway) and L-lactaldehyde.  Under aerobic conditions,
/L-lactaldehyde is oxidized in two steps to pyruvate, thereby channeling all the carbons from fucose or rhamnose
/into central metabolic pathways.  Under anaerobic conditions, L-lactaldehyde is reduced to L-1,2-propanediol, which
/is secreted into the environment.

UNIQUE-ID - PRPP-PWY
TYPES - Super-Pathways
COMMON-NAME - superpathway of histidine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis
COMMENT - Pyrimidine, purine, and pyridine nucleotide synthesis all require phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) as a precursor.  PRPP is utilized by both the de novo pathways and the auxiliary or salvage pathways by which endogenously formed or exogenously added pyrimidine, purine, or pyridine bases are converted to the corresponding ribonucleoside monophosphates by phosphoribosyltransferases. PRPP is also used in the histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways.  PRPP thus may be regarded as a precursor for the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and for the NAD(P) coenzymes.The formation of PRPP therefore is subjected to strict metabolic control. |CITS:[3009477]|
