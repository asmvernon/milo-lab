				<div class="title">About eQuilibrator<sub>&beta;</sub></div>

				<p>eQuilibrator is a simple web interface designed to enable easy thermodynamic analysis of biochemical systems.
				eQuilibrator enables free-text search for biochemical compounds and reactions and provides thermodynamic estimates for both in a variety of conditions.</p>

				<p>Estimation of thermodynamic parameters (&Delta;<sub>r</sub>G and &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G) elucidates how much energy is required to drive
				a particular biochemical reaction and in which direction the reaction will flow in particular cellular conditions [1-2].</p>
				
				<p>Because experimental measurement of the free energy of formation (&Delta;<sub>f</sub>G&deg;) of compounds is technically challenging, the vast
				majority of known metabolites have not been thermodynamically characterized. eQuilibrator uses a well-studied approximation of &Delta;<sub>f</sub>G called
				<emph>group contribution</emph> [3-4], enabling thermodynamic analysis of many biochemical reactions and pathways.</p>

				<p>Currently, eQuilibrator can provide estimates for many compounds in the KEGG database [5] (about 4500). Individual compounds can be searched for by their common names
				(‘water’, ‘glucosamine’, ‘serine’), and reactions can be entered in a simple, free-text format (‘ribulose bisphosphate + CO2 + water => 2 3-phosphoglycerate’)
				that eQuilibrator parses automatically. eQuilibrator also allows manipulation of the conditions of a reaction - pH, ionic strength, and reactant and
				product concentrations - to help explore the thermodynamic landscape of a biochemical reaction.</p>	
	
				<p>eQuilibrator is a project of the <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/plants/Milo/">Milo Lab</a> at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel.</p>

				<p>eQuilibrator makes heavy use of open source libraries and frameworks and is open-source itself. You can find the eQuilibrator source code on
				<a href="http://code.google.com/p/milo-lab/">Google Code</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The eQuilibrator back-end is implemented in pure <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> using the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django
				web framework</a> and several other open-source Python libraries, including <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> and <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/">Pyparsing</a>.
				The eQuilibrator user-interface is implemented using HTML, CSS and the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery Javascript framework</a>.</p>
